> ok i hate it when a book brings tears to my eyes and makes me feel emotional but i guess that is good for the author since she is obviously awesome at writing this book ... it is filled with sadness and poor mia had such a horrible life and went through so much abuse between father and boyfriend ... then she turns to food and bulimia ... my gosh it was just awful ... then she meets beautiful jordan who granted was a player but he fell for her and they really brought things out in each other that was so incredibly beautiful ... then there was the twist that ruined everything and i will leave it at that ... but this was really the best book by far ...

> `` dark places '' by gillian flynn is a masterfully written thriller/mystery . libby 's quirky character is one that wo n't soon be forgotten.the story flashes from present to past in alternating chapters , counterbalancing libby 's search for the truth with the tragedy of the past . on a snowy night in 1985 , then 7-year-old libby day hears her mother and two young sisters dying being murdered , assuming it was her teenage brother ben weilding the axe and shotgun . now , after being contacted by a 'kill club ' that studies serial killers , she 's not so sure her big brother was responsible.i strongly suggest this novel if you 're into mystery and thrillers . i bet you 'll never see the ending coming !

> these labels are great address labels . they feed easily into the printer and stick very easily to envelopes . this is a great product if you are doing mass mailings . the labels are a nice size , but not huge . they work better for smaller envelopes instead of the large manila envelopes . they are small enough that they can be used for return addresses on bigger envelopes . 750 labels is a lot for normal uses but if you have a large numbers of labels to print , this is a great value . the only thing that you may want to double check is that you have a laser printer because these are n't designed for inkjet printers . overall , this is a great product from 3m .

> not a bad candybar it tastes just fine , but i wo n't be giving up hershey 's or even cadbury 's dark chocolate bars anytime soon.what you are really paying for is the name & the opportunity to be politically correct . the candybar itself is half the size and more than twice the price of other dark choclate bars that are so similar in taste that the real bitter after-taste will be in your wallet . i would be more inclined to eat this more often if the pricing were more reasonable . even if you are trying to do the right thing ecologically all the more reason you should not be punished by paying more for it .

> in general , i found the writing choppy and had a hard time getting into the characters . told from the view point of anne , she was a easygoing , easy-to-bully girl who worked hard to support her sister through college . anne met mal , the drummer of stage dive at a party and he without her consent moved in to live with her . to me , their relationship did not go deep , just a lot of joking around . mal was the type that masked his true emotions with jest and as a reader i did not get the feeling that his feelings were sincere . perhaps it would be good to have alternating povs so that we understand what was going on in his mind especially with regards to anne .

> this green tea is much more sweet in the vein of asian `` bubble tea '' ( minus the tapioca pearls , of course ) than the fake-tasting cloying sweetness of american teas like arizona . the floating bits of fruit pulp and the distinct aftertaste of passion fruit also make it clear this is something unusual . i could n't taste the aloe vera , but the tea is a little `` heavier '' than one would expect if used to plain green tea.i found it refreshing with spicy food but a bit too substantial to drink by itself.the bright packaging and asian-looking design invoke japanese design , and the taste is similar to drinks i 've had on my travels as well as in asian restaurants in the us . recommended .

> vaseline cocoa butter lip therapy smells nice , the container is cute but the product is waxy like a cheap lip balm . i think this formulation is better for winter chapped lips when a thicker buffer against the elements is essential . however this product does not make kissable soft lips like plain old vaseline . it feels waxy on my lips and self-conscious to really smooch while it 's on.i would buy this for times i need to heal chapped lips but not for regular everyday use . i am looking forward to trying the vaseline rosy lips that 's a european favorite when available .

> the only things you want to know about `` the illusionist '' are these.1 . the fun of this movie is the mystery ... so do n't let anyone give you `` spoiler '' information.2 . although like every other movie , the fun of watching is in the suspending of disbelief , it is a movie that you have to pay attention to and think about . watch it with someone , but no fair guessing out loud.3 . my review . this is a very visual film ; there is a great feeling of time traveling to the setting of the film . this is a very dark , sad and romantic story that you will want to watch again . this is a very smart and clever film that reaches out and drags you in , and the ending is ... i wo n't tell !

> i have tried several of the products in secret 's clinical protection line . the big difference in them seems to be the scent . they seem to work about the same . that is better than your standard deodorant . even in the sticky southern summers , this product seems to do the trick . it has a light , pleasant scent . if you want people to smell your deodorant , this product is not for you , but if you want great protection without a strong scent , this one is great . the only downside is the size of the container . the clinical protection lines tend to be a little more expensive and come in smaller packages . i guess that is what you give for the increase in protection . overall , i would definitely recommend it !

> i actually got this product for a family member who lives right off of a golf course . there is all kinds of wildlife around their home -- rabbits , coyotes , quail , and of course mice . if they leave their garage door open , rabbits will tend to come inside looking for food and shelter . this was their dilemma . they did not want to leave poison out or the typical baited mouse trap that would harm the rabbits.kill and seal mouse trap solved the problem . it worked rather quickly . they set only one of them out the first night and a couple of days later it had caught a mouse . the other great part of using this trap is that you do n't have to handle the carcass.i recommend this product .

> i enjoy a variety of nuts for snacks and cooking . this is definitely more the snack-variety . i liked that the nuts tasted very fresh and had a pleasant aroma when i opened the canister . the canister itself is very convenient and wide enough to reach into for the snack without scraping your knuckles on a rough plastic rim . the pepper flavor is significant , but not overpowering . a good balance . however , i like salty snacks , but found this to be a little too salty , even at the risk of drowning out the flavor of the cashew . if you like very salty , these are good , but if you like mildly salty , steer clear . i ca n't even imagine how the ones on the bottom of the canister would taste .
