> *as of 5/25/14 - i am changing my opinion.as you can see by my original review below , i had issues with the first mat sent to me for testing . the company graciously sent out another one and i can safely say that nothing about this mat changes the flavor of the food baked on it . there may have been an issue with the first one , but i have a feeling that is was more to do with my taste buds on that day than anything else . the cookies baked on this new mat came out perfectly with no change in flavor.i also did another batch of cookies on the original mat and they came out with no change in flavor also.i have given my review a rise in stars from the 3 that i first judged it to be - to 5 for both the quality of the mat and the efficiency and caring attitude of the company.this mat was everything that it says it should be and does everything it is supposed to do . however i had one little issue with it . i washed this as recommended in warm soapy water ... twice ... before my first use.i decided to make the toll house cookies from a roll - i wanted something easy before i went for the more time consuming , since i 've never used a mat like this before.my cookies cooked very well , as well as if i 'd used parchment - there was no differences in the appearance of the cookies or how they spread when baking - until i tried one of the cookies and found that it had a very faint plastic-y taste to it.i will wash and dry the mat a few more times and try again.sample provided for testing and reviewing purposes

> i was impressed with rachael 's debut cd and eagerly awaited her second . that one disappointed me greatly , and i almost wrote her off . fortunately , a good review convinced me to give her another chance with this release.while the first cd had an adult contemporary feel and the second had more teen pop/latin , this cd manages to capture a rock/pop feel that works well for her . possibly that 's a result of her heavy involvement on every song on the disc.easily my two favorite songs are two of the ballads . `` no other one '' is a beautiful tribute to god . who is like him ? `` the art '' was written solely by rachael and is a surprisingly honest confession of human weakness and uncertainly relying on god . it has a haunting melody and is worth getting the cd for alone . if this song is any indication of what rachael can do writing alone , i hope she does it more in the future.there are some great upbeat moments as well . `` when i fall '' and the opening track `` all this time '' are highlights of these songs.frankly , the only two songs i do n't like on here are right next to each other . `` rubberhouse '' and `` outrageous '' seem more like holdovers from the last project and i do n't care for them musically . personal taste , i 'm sure , but they easily get skipped.after a disappointing sophomore release , rachael is back on my list of artists to keep an eye on . hopefully future releases will continue to be as strong as this one .

> this brush is advertised as being ideal for preventing brush wires from catching on new , coated drum heads . the design feature that allows that is a bend at the ends of the bristles . frankly , that idea makes no sense because you can very lightly run 400 grit over a new , coated head and immediately break the head in for brush playing . another problem with the intended use is once a head was broken in by the bent bristles , it starts to wear very quickly - a double whammy ! on the other hand , this brush is perfect for calf heads or heads designed to simulate calf , such as theremo skyntone drumhead , 14 inchandremo batter , fiberskyn , fd film , 14-inch diameter . those heads have a very subtle , calf skin like texture ( the skyntone even simulates pore holes ) that are good for ballads with regular brushes , but sometimes too subtle for other styles . these brushes , though , are perfect for those heads.i have also tried these brushes out on theremo ambassador batter , renaissance , 14-inch diameterwith excellent results.the balance and feel are not the same as my much preferred regaltip brushes ( every model i 've used seems to have great balance and feel ) , but that is a personal preference . you may wind up loving they way these feel . i have a few snare drums outfitted with calf , skyntone and fiberskyn heads , so i always keep a pair of these brushes in one of my stick bags . for those heads these are perfect .

> there is a tremendous literature around the big wars the united states has fought , the civl war , the two world wars . but this book is the first which deals with the many interventions the u.s. has engaged in since first taking on the barbary pirates in 1805. boot gives a history of these small wars , placing emphasis not only on their meaning for policy but on the actual battles themselves . one of the great pleasures for him he reports is telling the stories of heroes whose names are not generally known to the wider american public , as frederick funston , thomas ironside , stephen decatur . boot also reveals that these wars were often fought by the u.s. marines who have a long tradition of taking on difficult missions far from home.boot in telling the story wishes to contradict the powell doctine which emerged as major military planning lesson of vietnam . colin powell insisted that the united states must fight in the future only big wars which it could decisively win in a short time . boot succeeds in showing that the u.s. policy of intervention is a two- hundred year one which has been done not simply for commercial or military but often for idealistic reasons.boot is a strong believer in american military power as central factor in shaping a better world . not even relatively unsuccessful interventions are in his opinion , reason for the united states not to use its power wisely in the future .

> 22 years later , i still have the same problem with this movie that i had upon first seeing it . the king novel from which christine is based was set in a very snowy pittsburgh ; budget constraints compelled the moviemakers to switch the locale to sunny california so that the menacing blizzard which made the book so suspenseful is missing . other than that , though , director john carpenter still manages to scare up some thrills in this tale of a boy and his rather possessive car . while the reason for the evil car is never clearly explained , one can only surmise that when christine came off the assembly line , she had tasted blood and therefore has made a habit of taking lives in exchange for her supernatural powers . keith gordon ( dressed to kill ) plays the nerdy arnie who finds his life drastically changed once he stumbles upon the 1957 plymouth fury . not only does christine dish out carrie-like revenge on gordon 's tormentors , gordon himself becomes a rather macho man in return . ably supported by john stockwell , harry dean stanton , robert prosky and alexandra paul , christine captures some of the terror of carpenter 's classic halloween in exploring terror in rather `` ordinary '' means . while the ending does n't pack the wallop one would expect , the movie nevertheless is one of king 's more efficient adaptations .

> i do wish that the movie had been closer to the game in plot and setting - dennis hopper did a nice job playing koopa , but i missed the big green , redheaded monster that he was in the games . but set aside the expectations that this movie will be just like the games , and you will be satisfied by it . this movie certainly is n't the best of all times , but i liked the acting.many elements of the game have been retained , like bob-ombs , or goombahs ( although they have a considerably different look in the movie ) and yoshi even made an appearance ( though like the goombahs , he looked very different ) seeing big bertha as a buxom black woman with red clothing and spikes was funny , though the character of lena was unnecessary ( nothing personal against the actress herself ) the plot itself - entirely different from the games ( aside the whole princess-kidnapping scheme ) was believable when set in this world , with koopa 's desire to take over our own world . mario and luigi deliver a solid and humorous performance , and this movie is good for a rainy day or a casual viewing with friends ( perhaps along with a game of mario party , eh ? ) at night with snacks . 4 out of 5 stars for a fun film .
= not exactly like the game , but still enjoyable

> these airwick oil scents are a good pick if you want a powerful scent - they do deliver on that ! unfortunately , for my needs it 's a bit too powerful , to the point where it 's overwhelming in a small bathroom . the scent is noticeable throughout the full upper level of the house at a more muted level.granted , this situation is probably affected by the fact that all the windows are closed due to it still being wintery outside . i imagine in the warmer months when the windows are open the scent would be more manageable.the scent itself is just ok. a bit more of a `` chemical '' undertone than other scents i 've used , but not bad.i 'll give this three stars since it does not really appeal strongly to me due to the scent strength and smell , but it may be worth a look if you like a strongly-scented air freshner . [ note : although this review is tagged as a vine review , my shipment was lost , so i purchased one locally to do this review . ]

> forever ... is the most romantic teen love story ever written ! katherine and michael are normal teens who meet in a normal way - at a party ! what they have together is so bonding it seems like it will last forever . it 's also the most difficult kind of relationship , because they are truly in love.after meeting and going out a few times , katherine feels like she is in love . when she and michael begin getting closer in a sexual way , they both feel as if this could be it.if i say any more about the plot then i will give away the whole book ! once i started reading this book i could n't put it down ! it is n't often that you come across such an amazing love story because it is told as if ms. blume has really been in this intense of a relationship . forever ... is a must read for any older , mature teens due to sexual content.reviewed by : taylor rector

> ann rule did it all . she knew ted bundy before she knew he was a serial killer and after she 'd finally accepted he was one . she was also an experienced crime reporter who understood the legal system and sat through the legal proceedings as they dragged on and on . meanwhile , bundy kills throughout , with the worst being after he escapes from his first prison . rule even links him with yet an earlier murder in his hometown when he was only 15 , showing he started killing even earlier than she 'd previously supposed . i read the 35th printing of this book , which is no small testimony to how right she 's painted the portrait . if you 're going to read about a serial killer , there 's nothing like the real thing . i read this on a plane ride to florida and , although i normally detest flying , i barely noticed i was in a plane , i was so engrossed in this book .

> this was actually my second one of these i had owned . the first stopped being useful because the audio jack was too loose , which probably happened because i dropped it a few times . this one simply stopped charging , which i found out was rather common . since i did n't pay much for it , it would have been silly to get repaired , so i did n't , but since the problem i encountered was a common one i did n't want to throw good money after bad.now , when this works , it 's a great little budget player . i used it when i would cut grass and go to the gym . it was somewhat difficult to organize audio books -- even though you should be able to get some from audible -- but i made it work .

> interfact shakepeare series only includes macbeth and romeo and juliet so far . both books are easily readable and allow students and teachers to follow along in its setup . each scene is explained in a synopsis and the dialogue is faithful to shakespeare 's language . what makes this exceptional is the cd that comes with the book . the book also provides useful information and helps you out with the cd . the cd is a great asset and is filled with easy tests , games , and allows the teacher and students to explore macbeth without worrying about getting it wrong . this book and cd should be available to all literature and language arts teachers everywhere . macbeth should not have to be so hard . it 's worth the money , believe me . it 's truly a bargain .

> as a result of one of those compromises that make up just about every marriage , i was recently required to watch this romantic comedy . i usually avoid this type of movie like the plague , though i 'll freely admit there are a few that i 've actually enjoyed over the years . the holiday , my friends , is not one of them.this movie is bad even by `` chick flick '' standards . none of the characters are believable , the vast majority of their dialogue would never in a million years be uttered by sane human beings , and the whole storyline is both utterly unbelievable and utterly predictable . so many romantic comedy clich & eacute ; s are trotted out that if you threw in some juvenile humor you 'd have a parody to rival `` date movie '' . the acting is as bad as the story . cameron diaz , in particular , takes bad acting to a whole new level , and do n't even get me started on jack black . i went into this movie thinking `` sure it 's a chick flick , but at least hugh grant 's not in it . besides , it 's got jack black . how bad can it be ? '' black 's character and performance are so lukewarm that god help me i might have preferred hugh grant.i was going to write off my reaction to the holiday as the typical male response to the genre , but my wife hated it too , and she loves romantic comedies . file this movie under `` avoid at all costs '' .ps - my wife 's side of the deal was to watch the latest bond movie ( casino royale ( two-disc widescreen edition ) ) with me , and we were unimpressed by that one as well . sometimes you just ca n't win .

> last night 's bargain-rack movie dvd was `` the rainmaker '' starring matt damon and danny de vito and directed by francis ford coppola . damon was a new lawyer , fresh out of law school , and just passing the bar exam . de vito was a paralegal assistant who had failed the bar exam six times . they paired up at a sleazy ambulance-chasing law firm until the heat got too high , then left to form and open their own law office in an ultra-low-rent part of town and began their own type of ambulance chasing . some of their cases were really pathetic , including the main case in the movie . a young man was near death with leukemia and a sleazy health insurance company with high-powered attorneys refused to pay for the needed bone-marrow transplan to keep him alive . he died . the case went to court . it was damon and de vito , baptized under fire , against the powerful lawyers of the insurance company . well , you know who 's going to win , or we would n't have a movie , but it was still an exciting drama to witness.the acting in this movie was quite excellent . it was the first major movie for damon and he excelled . i do n't particularly care for de vito , but i 'd here give him credit for the best acting i 've ever seen him do . the rest of the cast was more than adequate . the filming , sound and direction were excellent . the story had a nice flow and attention never waned . the story was gripping and somewhat gut wrenching . about the only ones who did n't fare well were the lawyers and health insurance company people . oh well , they 're probably used to abuse . it was a good movie . very well done.gary peterson

> one of the pictures in this book shows a much , much younger joan mellen with jim garrison in 1969. it sppears that since then she has been collecting more and more information about what we might call the jim garrison view of the kennedy assassination . this book can then be viewed as the wrapping up of a lifetime of kennedy research.ms . mellen 's point of view is that jim garrison was right in his investigation and subsequent prosecution of clay shaw for conspiracy in the case . along the way she presents the evidence as collected for the trial , and supplements it with a great deal more . this includes both documentary and personal testimony that she has collected subsequent to the trial.i do n't think that the non-conspiracy believers are going to be convinced , and the conspiracy buffs seem to have so many different points of view that they can not agree on a single approach.there is an awful lot of material here . but as you try to sort through it , keep in mind that when the jury was finally given the clay shaw case it only took them fifty-four minutes to reach a verdict of not guilty .

> i was skeptical at first . how could this have such great reviews ? well that 's probably because it really is that good . i 've had it for a month now , and there have been absolutely no problems . signal is great . speed is considerably faster than my old router . design is slick , and i have never lost a connection . if you need a new router just go with this one . great company -would easily buy from again .

> this think thin bar offers 20 grams of protein and 240 calories of gluten free natural nutrition . other reviewers have complained about the taste , but this reviewer did n't find it so bad . the caramel fudge taste is subdued , and the chocolate outer layer is a nice touch . it might be best to try it for personal taste before buying them in quantity .

> the bob hope character never really aged but the body and film parts did . here he plays the single father of a teen-aged daughter who , in the traditional way , was having trouble adjusting . the problem for the viewer in 2010 is pretty much the same as the problem one would have watching ( or reading about ) marjorie morningstar deliberating as to whether she should surrender her sacred virginity before marriage . happily , no writers for bob hope would dare slip in a serious three minutes , perhaps they would be allowed one , if there were a big laugh punch line following it . of course , these are not kids abusing illegal substances , living in communal cesspools , or being hassled by the police for a variety of `` out of their mind '' deviances . they are kids who are doing early rock and roll and some of the fun dances of the day . who could accuse the frankie avalon and tuesday weld of this film of anything worse than ... .well , perhaps it was the fate worse than death . at any rate , the film is very light fun with dina merrill looking beautiful , tuesday weld being a model upper middle class teen-ager in love with the next good looking guy who comes her way , and bob hope , being the bewildered , funny , father who still gets his girl as well . a few bouncy tunes liven up the proceedings and we know throughout that every one will find the right mate for life by the end of the film .
= ring in nostalgia
< bob hope is a great film

> computer world is an album that focuses on simplicity and repetitive beats . normally this is enough to discourage me away from it like a virus , however ... this album is actually pretty good.every single track is melodic enough to keep me interested , and let 's not forget the overall influential electronic *sound* of the album that 's considered fairly groundbreaking by early 80 's standards . when the 70 's pretty much featured most of the originators- here comes kraftwerk 's computer world indicating once again that the well has n't run dry just yet.even though i 'm hearing the album for the first time right now , this kind of music does take me back to the early 80 's because it has that familiar dance vibe reminiscent of popular bands like duran duran and the talking heads . in fact this album was released six weeks before i was born so the vibes are quite strong for me personally.plus it 's interesting to hear a bands interpretation of what the computer world was like ( or *could* have been ) back in the early 80 's . no ladies and gentlemen- the world of computers was n't exactly focused around the internet and fast speed connections back then , haha.anyway , kraftwerk never really won me over when listening to their fairly aimless early 70 's albums , but this one ... is good .
= good enough

> girl in progress starring eva mendes and newcomer cierra ramirez is a really sweet and thoughtful film . i was never a big fan of eva mendes before i saw this indie flick . mendes is pretty to look at , but her acting for me was never very strong . but i must admit , mendes is extraordinary and fearless in girl in progress . mendes plays grace , a single mother who 's young daughter decides to make me her own `` coming-of-age '' adventure to try and frazzle her absentee mom . grace is a mess emotionally , she is having an affair with a married doctor , she 's working 2 meaningless jobs , and she ca n't afford to pay for her daughter 's private school tuition . her daughter , ann is young and precocious , she feels like her mom never pays attention to her which is sad but true . ann is smart but she is neglected , her mom refuses to act her age and ann wants to grow up too fast . girl in progress is a real and honest film , i thought the ending was satisfying and made me tear up a little . i highly recommend this underrated gem , enjoy ! kudos to eva mendes for getting out of her comfort zone !
= growing pains , they never really end .
< sweet and thoughtful

> once again , the author has given me a story that involves an aspect of the napoleonic wars about which i previously knew nothing , the bombardment of copenhagen in 1807. of course , he has put his intrepid hero , richard sharpe , right into the center of it , alongside actual historical characters . it 's an exciting tale , as always with the sharpe series , although we get to see a little of the softer side of sharpe , as he grieves for his lost grace , who died in childbirth . sharpe is the early 19th century james bond , always getting into and out of near-impossible situations , and always seeming to find a beautiful woman to share some time with him . the settings appear factual , and i assume that the details of the action are quite correct . now that this tale is told , i wonder where sharpe 's adventures will take him next , for it appears that most of the time from 1807 until waterloo has been covered by other books in this series . i can only hope the author finds other adventures for richard sharpe , for i would miss him terribly if there were no further works about him .

> this was a very well written book which i had no problem getting into . it centers on three lifelong friends who when teenagers were nicknamed the supremes as they hung out at earl 's . time and earl 's has seen these ladies through the joys and trials encountered over several decades . their friendship with its close personal bonds has sustained the supremes and earl 's is the place that feeds their bodies and souls during the current year which has presented someserious challenges to life as the supremes know it.i liked this book a lot . the characters were well developed and easy to get invested in . i could relate to the three women and their unique level of friendship . on a personal level it reminded me of my own friendship with a couple of girls which has survived romances , careers , marriages , kids , deaths , and divorce . the narrative and dialogues ring true and the author has constructed a story populated witb interesting people and situations that i became invested in.this book was a journey that i was hoping would not end .

> denzel washington gives a brilliant performance in the story of `` hurricane '' carter , a black boxer who is unjustly accused and convicted of murder . he is a man who is discriminated against because of his race , and who throughout his life seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time . washington portrays him as a cocky young boxer in his early days and traces his growing bitterness as he is wrongly imprisoned for a crime he did n't commit . he enters a survival mode in prison and is uncommunicative with those around him . his protective wall is broken down by a young teenager who reads his book , and who admires him for his accomplishments before he was in prison . the young man visits him in prison , and with the help of some caring adults that he is living with , begins to fight for his release . this is a story of justice and redemption and is a moving tribute to a man who stayed strong through the most difficult of circumstances .

> first of all , this book is highly entertaining . the action sequences in the battle room are very very well written and you feel like you are there a part of it.but if it was only entertaining it would just be another fun science fiction novel . what sets this apart is that it is thought provoking . ender is a great character who while most of ca n't really relate to him ( i mean he is the smartest brightest kid in the world whose was taken from his parents and forced to enter military school ) but most of us can at least feel for his situation.what really makes this book is the astounding ending . it is suprising , truimphant , heart wrenching , horrifying , terrible and thought provoking all at the same time . one of the best endings of all time and the best science fiction book i have ever read .

> this is one of the best tv series ever and is worthy of every one of its five stars . season two continues the intricate plot in which phillip and elizabeth jennings , apparently a model family in the suburbs , are actually kgb deep cover agents engaged in spying against the us government.the time is circa 1980 , shortly after president reagan is elected president so in this sense the series is a period piece . the kgb is deeply paranoid about president reagan , the star wars program , the central american contra initiative , and pretty much everything that reagan did to finally defeat the soviets . but that has not happened yet and in fact , in this series , the kgb often wins.this is an excellent series that is head-and-shoulders above the usual hollywood stuff . it is highly addictive and entertaining and i never miss an episode . rjb .

> ink cartridges are , as almost everyone knows , hugely profitable for the printer companies who have even taken refillers and imitators to court in order to perfect theier monopoly . i used to buy third-party cartridges - and destroyed an epson printer with a bad cartridge . the vendor , whom i purchased from before , basically disclaimed responsibility.since then i use only ink cartridges from the printer manufacturer . true , they are obscenely expensive , but i have n't lost a printer to them either.the hp 88xl installs in my hp printer without hassle and delivers trouble free performance . the page output quantity is easily twice as much as from the standard size cartridge.so , i hate paying the price , but i am getting what i pay for in this instance : lots of pages and trouble free operation.jerry

> while conceding that i have enjoyed many john grisham novels , and also conceding that i liked the racketeer enough to give it 3 stars , there is still a lingering disappointment that this was the best grisham could do this year . readers look forward to his really good legal thrillers , and to finish this one only moderately satisfied means we have to wait longer still for him to do his really good stuff . it 's a cute story , but the deck seemed so stacked that the suspension of belief required to enjoy it felt really forced . perhaps grisham is ready to retire to antigua and needed a few more bucks before he could go ... but , what 's he going to read when he gets there ? surely even he wants to read only the best .

> living in europe , i had to bite the bullet and buy an overpriced ( approx $ 50 ) hdmi cable from the store that sold me my tv . i ordered this hdmi cable from amazon and picked it up on a recent trip back to the us . as far as i can tell there is absolutely no difference in performance with this cable compared to the overpriced one on my other component . the spotlight reviews do an excellent job of explaining why this hdmi cable works just as well as the overpriced alternatives .

> like the disclaimer under the info for this book says , it would be ideal if the reader were at least seventeen before reading this book . that being said , i thought this book was a refreshing change from the usual young adult novel . the author has done a good job with her characters . all of them have a past that is touched on enough to make them dimensional and interesting but she does n't spend much time jumping back and forth from before to now . the main character is humorous and helps keep the story moving along at a good pace.the romance in this book is different . the characters are able to develop a friendship before they get into a relationship and they have a good balance of conflict and tension to balance out the romance between them . i really liked that the author did n't turn this into an everyone lived perfectly happy after that kind of story . her characters are still flawed and have things to accomplish at the end of the book.the one thing that i would have liked to have seen in this book was a bit more personal growth of the main character . she was heavily insecure throughout the story and i did n't feel that changed much by the end of the book.overall this was a very enjoyable book and i would recommend it .

> married couple , ryan and carly , and myles and olivia are long time friends . they often spend time vacationing together . ryan and olivia work for the same company and as a result of working in such close proximity , they develop feelings for each other . after a party hosted by myles and olivia , things go a little too far between ryan and olivia . when myles confronts ryan about what happened that night , the truth he reveals will leave readers reeling and sends ryan down a slippery slope.unfaithful follows two couples as they learn the consequences of what one moment , when things get out of hand , can do to a solid marriage . this story is the classic example that things are n't always as they seem and it could have taken so many directions . scott surprised and entertained me with the path he took in laying out the plot . married couples , best friends for years , yet they really did n't know each other at all . just when you think the drama could n't get any higher , another explosive scene erupts . purely entertaining.reviewed by paula hendersonof the rawsistaz ( tm ) reviewers

> i got this scale as a replacement for a `` chatty cathy '' scale model that was really neat as long as it worked , but of course , that was the problem . it worked ok for awhile , then went intermittent then stopped.while this scale does n't talk to you , it works ... and it works immediately , not requiring you to step on & off & back on to activate.customer support is amazing , not that i 've needed any . this company actually has someone watching either the amazon sales or the feedback , who then gives you a quick `` thank you '' e-mail and a request to let them know if there are any problems . the other reviews address this in more detail , but in today 's world of disposable consumer goods , it 's great to know that someone actually cares about the stuff they sell you after they already have your money.it 's such a good scale , we got a second identical scale for a different location in the house.great scale & great customer service , all at a fair price ... you ca n't really ask for more .

> i did n't enjoy this book nearly as much as i thought i would . the basic premise is intriguing : the main character , ursula , keeps dying over and over and over again , and the reader gets to see how her life trajectory would have been impacted by simple changes . so , ursula dies ( snow ... this gets old ... you 'll understand if you choose to read it for yourself ) . then , she 's alive again in the next chapter , living an alternate reality of sorts . i thought the basic narrative was very unique , but for some reason it just got old after a while . maybe knowing that ursula would somehow learn a lesson from something she did and survive to live another day just got kind of repetitive . the author is clearly a gifted storyteller , but i quickly lost interest in the book , and never formed much of an attachment to the main characters . i do n't really understand why this was one of the best-selling books of 2013 .

> my review is slanted entirely to those with sufficient hearing loss to need subtitles fully to understand a film in which a good deal of the dialogue is either whispered , accompanied by clanging , banging , sound effects , or adapted only to those with quite superior natural hearing . i always listen via excellent headphones but this was one of those soundtracks which just could not be heard clearly . once upon a time , all american soundtracks , at least , were made so that one could hear every word spoken even when sitting in the last row of the great movie palaces of the day . now the sound is subject , apparently , to artistic manipulation , and even those with only mild hearing loss are unable to grasp what is being said.so far as i could see , the movie might well have had some good qualities , but i have to leave the telling of that story to those who could hear it .

> my sister gave me this book for christmas , although it 's a children 's book and i 'm 43 years old . it 's about a weird sixth grader named dwight who goes around with an origami yoda on his finger . origami yoda gives advice to middle school students , which usually turns out to be good advice . tommy wonders how origami yoda can give such good advice when dwight seems like a clueless loser . so he assembles a case file to try to determine whether origami yoda is really tapping into the force or if dwight is just faking it . the chapters of the book take the form of students writing about their experiences with origami yoda . this is a very entertaining book for kids and middle aged fanboys . enjoy it you will .

( there is a large female beagle in my neighborhood named shiloh . she 's beautiful ) .my beagle has been a pet therapy dog for senior citizens in a nearby nursing home . she has been great medicine for the folks there and one nurse said she had gotten a beagle because she liked my dog . she could n't think of a name for the dog , so i suggested `` clover , '' in honor of the literary shiloh 's real counterpart . `` clover , like in a good luck charm , '' i said at the time . i was delighted to learn days later she named her hound clover . shiloh is a continuum of love . it 's great .

> if you love pink floyd then this hits package is probably not needed . after all you already have their cd 's anyways . however it does have a track that is not available anywhere else . so for that reason you may want it . that song is 'when the tigers broke free ' , tiger tanks killed roger waters father during ww2 , and this song is about that . it was recorded for the wall , and was in the movie but not the cd version . so if you want that song then you need this release . if you want a great bunch of pink floyd songs that are from 1967-83 and do n't want to buy their full cds , then you will like this release as well . the sound is remastered and that is a good thing as well . the songs styles are psych rock to prog rock and it does feature some real classic songs on here like 'money ' and such . if you love prog rock or psych rock then this is a good one for you . if you are collecting pink floyd then this is also a good one for you as you will want the tiger song . it is a good overview of the band , on that regard you may want it too .

> i have a new kitten who loves to play . that means biting and scratching ! i 'm trying to teach her not to attack my hands and feet but she is n't fully trained and probably will take some time to outgrow her tendencies . so this past week i got a scratch on my hand that hurt and looked really red and inflamed . i tried a prescription cream from my doctor but it did absolutely nothing . the area was still red and painful . so i decided to try this colloidal silver salve and was amazed at how fast my skin has healed . within days the irritation stopped and the redness went away . i put this on my skin at least 5 times a day . when you apply it is very viscous and then forms a skin over the wound . so to use this effectively you need to dampen a cloth to remove the old layer so you can apply a new layer of salve . from my experience this has been a very healing and calming solution . i can highly recommend this if you have any skin problems whatsoever . you will be very impressed with how fast this salve works.~the rebecca review

> love never fails written by carla victoria wallace tells the story jada calloway , a single , christian woman , patiently awaiting the man of her dreams . when she is reconnected with mike , a young man from her former church , it 's obvious that there is no love connection as mike is dishonest and still very immature . while she tries to hide the fact that she finds pete , her friend tonya 's brother , attractive , she still ca n't put the fact that he 's white behind her . after so many years of being ridiculed as a kid by white children , jada vowed that she 'd never consider dating outside of her race . luckily , love knows no color.love never fails was an okay , yet predictable read . i really did n't see the point of adding the mike character into the storyline . i loved that the book uses christianity to help the young lovers bind together in the mist of trouble and how the title ties into the story.3.5 stars

( btw i mostly read with it , however when i do watch movies or use apps or the internet there is a very big difference in the video quality ) one more thing , if you use your kindle to read often like i do , you will really appreciate the ability to change the background to a sort of cream color . it greatly reduces the strain on your eyes from staring at a screen for long periods of time .

> square and disney coming together to bring us a video game turned out to really be a good move , i think . kingdom hearts ii is an improvement over the original . maybe not a big improvement , but enough to consider purchasing.the graphics are really good and the difficulty is unfortunately , sort of easy . the game is really big and contains a monster storyline so it 's not like the easiness means you can blow through the game on a lazy saturday afternoon . it just means you wo n't have much trouble moving through the game . i guess axel was a fairly challenging fight . some other fights are sort of difficult , as well.i 'm not entirely sure what to think about the idea of having to complete certain tasks in order to progress forward , but i guess it 's not that big of a deal . worth buying ? absolutely .

> for the last few years , my doctor has advised me to add more fiber to my diet , preferably in the foods i eat , but with fiber supplements if necessary . i 've used several fiber products , including benefiber , with good results . i 've mixed the benefiber with drinks and applesauce , but i prefer to mix it with plain water . the finely milled powder dissolves very quickly and has a neutral taste that makes it easy to swallow . benefiber is sugar-free , although a 2-teaspoon serving has 15 calories , all from carbohydrates . a serving contains 3 grams of soluble fiber , about 10 % of the recommended daily amount of dietary fiber . the fiber in benefiber is from wheat dextrin , a manufacturing by-product . the gluten content in benefiber is low enough ( less than 20 ppm ) that the fda allows it to be labeled as `` gluten-free . `` fiber supplements like benefiber are believed to have several health benefits , including cholesterol reduction , gastrointestinal health , and weight management . those are all good reasons for taking fiber supplements , but as someone approaching seventy years old , one of my biggest concerns is regularity . adding fiber to my diet , especially soluble fiber like that found in benefiber , has been extremely helpful in avoiding constipation.benefiber is recommended for use in any noncarbonated drinks , soft foods , and for baking . based on my experience using benefiber for several years , i recommend it as a good way to add fiber to your diet .

> the city of falling angels has it all . a mystery that needs to be solved , curious and eccentric characters and an odd sense of `` been there done that .

> when nintendo stopped making games for their nintendo 64 , many people seemed to balme it on the playstation 2. ironically there are many video games that were still worth the price . for the good games , like mario tennis , it does suit that field just fine . the game features 14 different characters to serve up your life , including mario and his brother luigi , yoshi , bowser and peach , princess toadstool for those die hard mario brothers fans . the game also features amazing details of games including skilled ring games , and tournaments and hidden courses with zany mario themes.although many people still do n't give sanction to cartridge games anymore , unless they are on game boy advance , mario tennis is dull for a one-player game , but a smash for four .

> this is a short , and fun , little novella that will get you thinking of the `` what if '' moments if the technology were real : in this case , what would really be the case if you woke up as a cloned human and your memories are of yesterday being in reality a couple of hundred years in the past ? the author does a good job of sucking you into the moment and feeling as if you are the main character . the technology and scenarios are realistic enough for this sci fi fan and , if you like a good storyteller mr. mcelhaney knows how to do it . at 99 cents , this one is a bargain and i recommend it .

> if you 're looking for a low calorie alternative to hot chocolate , especially as winter is coming , i would recommend this one as it does have a good taste . sure , it 's not as robust as a big ` ole cup of the full-leaded chocolate , but what are you expecting with a 25 calorie offering ? about the only complaint i have about this is it tends to clump here and there - i have to start smashing the clumps of chocolate on the side with a spoon to get the water to absorb and mix.i guess i should n't say i added marshmellows to this low-calorie alternative ... ..but i did !

> keyboard is not full size and some of the keys are in weird places . i 'm continually missing the return key and hitting the up arrow.important : keyboard has an on/off switch . if you leave it on , you will quickly drain the batteries.update : using the included extender for the usb receiver part seems to take care of the repeating keys problem that caused me to give it one star before . of course , this also means you have to unplug it before putting it in a carrying bag -- without the extender it 's small enough to just leave plugged in .

> i became interested in reading the gangs of new york after reading about the triangle factory fire and the influence of tammany hall in both . i first watched the martin scorsese movie of the same name . the movie takes a few characters from the nonfiction book and shuffles them in with fictional characters and then dramatizes the whole bit . i did n't really enjoy the movie , but after reading the book , i can definitely see its influence . gangs picks up with the gangs around 1840 in the bowery , the five points area . asbury 's details about the gangs of this period are fascinating , and the characters are incredibly colorful . but along with asbury 's tale of crime , he also creates a heartbreaking story of the fight for survival in new york during this time . americans born here resented immigrants and the immigrants turned on each other . poverty was grinding and devastating ; you almost ca n't blame the residents for turning to crime just to survive . the book really takes off in its description of the draft riots of 1863. the riots swept the city destroying buildings and nearly entire neighborhoods . the death toll equalled that of some of the worst battles of the civil war . the compelling tales end around the turn of the century and become just recitations of murder and revenge without placing them in the context of the times . the book was originally released in 1928 so there are several outdated racist terms , and asbury uses quite of a bit of bigotry when referring to the chinese . i do wish that in this new edition some updated information could have been added along with more pictures . it 's hard for me to imagine someone named ida the goose as inspiring a gang war that left several men dead . pictures are definitely required !
= 1928 expose of gangs shows it age

> alex proyas , the man who brought us the movie adaption of the crow ( the first and only good one ) , returns with his latest incarnation , the fantastic dark city . rufus sewell plays john murdoch , a man who ca n't remember who he is , and why he 's being accused of murder . but what john does know is something is not right with the city , and the people he meets on his journey looking for his home , change his life forever , and his ultimate discovery changes everything . to say this movie is a mindtrip is saying it lightly . alex proyas has a very vivid sense of direction , the sets and cinematography are like none i 've ever seen in a movie , not to mention the storyline was the most original story at it 's time ( the matrix takes a page from it ) , add that to great performances from sewell , kiefer sutherland , and william hurt , and you have a very special movie that only comes along not very often . the special effects are a very nice touch too and add to the experience even more . in my view dark city is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made , it beats the matrix , star wars , star trek , and every sci-fi franchise in great measure . the ending will haunt you for a while and leave you breathless when the climax unfolds . all in all , this is a sci-fi classic that should be seen by everyone whether they love sci-fi movies or not . thank you alex proyas for making a truly legendary film .

> this kit is for those within the ages of 10-100. it is a 4 by 4 sturdy plastic hand held loom , with a 6 inch weaving needle and a 3 inch sewing needle . the kit included directions with illustrations and step by step written directions . the booklet of directions included three patterns : a scarf , a placemat , and a reader case.before i used it with my nine year old , i used the directions and yarn i had at home , to weave the loom . the illustrations were essential to understand the written directions . as i wove i found that if i did not use a finger to hold down the yarn each time i made a curve , then the yarn would slip . this was not in the directions but something to be aware of as you wrap the loom.my daughter then began the weaving . because we used two different colors of yarn she was able to see if she made an error in her weaving pattern . she finished one square easily.so in preparing the loom again for weaving a second square , i allowed her to look at the illustrations and we went through the step by step directions together.she was able to accomplish this with a little help.i feel , because she has learned other crafts that the loom and directions were maybe easier for her to handle.this is a great activity to take on a trip as it is easy to carry and the materials are simple . i think it would make a nice gift for someone who enjoys crafts . *i received this for review - all opinions are my own*

> you 've seen the trailers from `` hancock '' . if you 're like me , you always wonder if you 've seen the best of the film . in this case , no . the trailers are from the first part of the movie where john hancock ( will smith ) is having a bit of a pr problem.okay , that 's the understatement of the year . he 's having a huge pr problem , namely he 's so drunk and unpredictable , no one wants him to show up on a crime scene . but , one man , pr specialist jason batemen ( ray embrey ) believes in him . so does his son , aaron ( jae head ) . his wife , mary ( charlize theron ) does not.with embrey 's coaxing , hancock decides to rehabilitate himself and he voluntarily goes to jail . meanwhile , embrey is working on him . the plan : crime 's so bad in la the cops will ask for an early release and hancock 's got to be ready -- with manners and a new sharper image.he is . and he wows them . he still does n't wow mary . and that 's the real story , john hancock 's secret identity . go for the cgi at the first and be prepared to be surprised in the second.warning : if you have migraines , seizures , or like me , get dizzy , `` hancock '' has some scenes you may want to avoid.rebecca kyle , july 2008

> trust me , i 'm referring to splendor in its most literal sense . it pulls many strands of story together : the boy with a love-quest , a triad of evil witches , fratricidal princes , and so many more that they 'd all be spoilers ( no spoilers - keep reading ) . each piece sounds like something you read your kid to sleep with , hoping desperately that the little one conks out before you do.same pieces , different story.it 's not just the arrangement of the classic pieces that makes it work but the interleaving of the different pieces , right down to the end . but gaiman has welded all the scraps together , so that the magical opening premise drives directly towards the finale , but with plenty of twists and turns in between.i could pick a few nits with this movie , but choose not to . there 's a beautiful maiden , of course , but she 's really beautiful instead of plastic-perfect pretty . a few bits of plot continuity seemed a little ham-handed , but that 's ok. let your pre-movie dinner have another glass of wine , or bring a kid who wants to feel clever at seeing the foretellings . it 's a bit complex for the littler kids , but otherwise reasonably safe for the young'uns . and it 's great for the grown-ups , if you 're willing to believe that i 'm one. -- wiredweird

> `` the bucket list '' can be best summed up as `` jack nicholson and morgan freeman pose for green screen postcards . '' freeman and nicholson open the movie enjoying their favorite vices ; for freeman , it 's a cigarette , while nicholson drinks in the scent of rare coffee . both are stricken with cancer . they find themselves in the same cancer ward.carter chambers ( morgan freeman ) suffers from lung cancer , as if it 's divine retribution . he 's surrounded by his devoted family . alone , gazillionaire edward cole ( jack nicholson ) suffers from brain cancer . rob morrow , the policeman from cbs ' `` numbers '' , stars as his joking doctor . both cole and chambers learn they have only a year to live , so they live it up . there 's tons of exposition looong before they go on their epic journey.with green screens as their backdrop , cole and chambers enjoy skydiving , racing on the great wall of china , seeing the taj mahal and the pyramids of egypt . ( why not junction city , oregon , home of the scandinavian festival , or hobbiton usa in the northern california redwoods ? ) it 's very cliched . `` bucket list '' is , despite the leading actors ' talents , and freeman 's omnipresent narration , deadly dull .

> this is my first humidifier -- and i ca n't believe i have n't tried one before . it works great.i was concerned about it getting my furniture/carpet wet - but the lighter settings totally prevent that.because of the reviews/instructions , i clean it every other day with water/vinegar and once a week with a little bleach . i wish there was a humidifier that i did n't have to clean as much , but that 's my only complaint.anyone who suffers from coughs/nasal issues or has a dry house in the winter should try one of these . i used to think it was normal to wake up in the middle of the night to drink water/suck on cough drops during cold weather or allergy season -- not anymore.update : i 've found a helpful way to maintain my humidifier since the weekly bleaching was a pain . i bought a second one and alternate them every other night . this way , each gets to dry out for about 36 hours in between uses . i still do cleanings , but do n't have to do it as much since they dry out completely in between uses.also , you need to change the filter regularly .

> for months i have wanted wireless , but most of my friends had horror stories about the set up with a dsl modem . i like to think of myself as techie but i am really just a wannabe . i actually was able to set the router up simply by following the directions provided . i have been happy ever since . i did have an occasion to use tech support this morning- i had turned off the power strip that the modem and router were connected to , and i had no connection . lucy ( i hope i remembered your name correctly ) walked me right thru the problem and i can now get back online . i found out that instead of shutting off the power strip , simply pull the power cords out from the back of both router and modem . then you restart computer . next the dsl modem must be hooked back up first and the lights working before inserting the power cord to the router as the router is so fast . another thing i discovered this morning , resetting the router works best with internet explorer , firefox does not respond well .

> i paid full price for the belkin silicon sleeve phone casebelkin silicone sleeve case for iphone 3g , 3g s ( pink , white ) ( $ 35 ) and when it stretched and got so loose it kept falling off in my bag , i thought i would go for something cheaper this time . i found this on amazon and could n't believe the price , so i ordered it . they said it would take up to a month shipping time , but it came much faster than that . it snapped on perfectly and it feels like i 've got a new phone . it 's much tougher than the belkin sleeve , it actually feels more protective and it 's feminine but not too girly . my phone is white and the purple shows up very nicely on the back . it also does n't affect the charger at all ( some cases do ) would buy from again and highly recommend .

> if i were away from home on business or a vacation , or running through an airport , i would always feel safe picking up a lee child book versus any others on the rack . as jack reacher would say `` it 's always 50-50 '' , but i know that the odds are far greater that i will enjoy another reacher novel.i was a little ambivalent about the ending of this book . it unwound quickly and did n't really give you much of an impact . but upon thinking about it for a bit , it was an appropriate ending given the antagonists and their perspectives on life . my personal opinion is that people who harm innocents should pay at least as dramatic a price as the victims . but i guess that is why justice is such an elusive concept.now if i can just get the picture of tom cruise ( as the movie jack reacher ) out of my mind !

> this is an excellent resource for when you have a child and you need to explain a death . the book is set up in question and answer format so it is easy to find the answer you might expect your children to ask and get some help on how to answer the question.i believe it would have been helpful to have had a section about ages and stages of children so that you might know what to expect as children go through the grieving process at different ages in their lives.i am glad to have this resource though as i expect we will be using it soon and because it is such an emotional topic and generally you have to work through your own issues as you are helping your children ; it is nice to have a place to start when talking with your kids.worth the money .

> the appeal of `` logan 's run '' is much like that of the original `` star trek '' . mildly intriguing story lines with arch acting and cheesy costumes , effects , and art direction . in a way i kind of prefer these sci-fi films from a more innocent time before cgi obliterates the craftmanship that went into these films . `` logan 's run '' is at once fascinating and campy . it addresses pet seventies issues like overpopulation and the environment . it 's a little dated but still retains the fun factor . my only gripe is that it suffers a little bit from overlength and beats it 's message into the ground somewhat .

> although there is much more intimate detail than i regard as ideal , this book provides some fascinating insights into a world that is scarcely known to outsiders . many horse racing fans do n't even look at the pedigrees of their favorite horses , although i showed more interest once i started recognizing some of the names . even so , it 's one thing to recognize that a horse is a son or daughter of a horse you saw a few years ago , but quite another to read about the trials and tribulations of stud farms . this book at least sheds some light on the subject.there is a lot more to successful breeding than just the actual mating , although there is plenty here about mating - everything from doing it naturally ( as insisted on by thoroughbred authorities ) to artificial insemination ( allowed by other authorities ) . while the author discusses artificial insemination , he mostly discusses thoroughbreds , maybe because of the extra variation it offers.when not preoccupied with mating rituals , the author discusses other aspects of the horse breeding industry . the second chapter is about auctions and the third about the history of the horse since it was first domesticated . the latter topic really needs a book to itself to do it justice , and i see that not everybody appreciates its inclusion here , although i enjoyed it . the final chapter is about shetland ponies who are allowed to live in semi-wild conditions in america for the benefit of university researchers . but mostly , it is those thoroughbreds that grab the author 's attention.i liked the book , but found some of the detail a little overdone , so it gets four stars rather than five . still , at the giveaway price i paid for it , i 'm certainly not complaining .

> this anker `` uspeed usb 3.0 7 port hub + 1 charging port '' installs easily and is very fast , making it a great addition to my office desktop . i recently installed a usb 3.0 card in my older tower computer , but the usb 3.0 ports are all in the rear and hard to reach , so this hub has made a world of difference in allowing me to conveniently connect high-speed usb devices to the pc . here are my observations : included ; hub , power supply , usb 3.0 cable , and instruction manualpros -+ easy install ; windows vista automatically recognized the hub and it was ready to use in under a minute+ quality ; this is well made and looks `` professional '' + speed ; very fast transfer speeds , we moved large video files between drives much faster than with my old usb 2.0 hub+ charging port ; has a dedicated 2a port to charge high draw devices ( ipads , etc ) cons -- large power supply ; this comes with a laptop style power supply that is about the same size as the actual hub , not really an issue for me since this stays on my desk but would be bulky to carry around in my laptop bagoverall i am quite impressed with the performance of this hub ! highly recommended ! cfhnote : unit provided for review

> god this for my birthday as a gift and carry it with me everywhere ever since . its an amazing thing ! holds 3500 books ! for a book-lover like i am its a dream come true . to carry 1 books when you travel can be heavy ( with all the additional luggage ) , but now i can carry as many books as i want and not feel a difference . woo hoo ! ! ! battery works well . lasted 3 months till i needed to recharge it . and i read every day . alot.wi-fi works well . but little bit sad , that most of books are 9 $ and more . paperback can be as cheap as 0.01 $ , so its hard to pay 9 $ for kindle . but i dont have to wait when it will be mailed . i get it in seconds.i didnt get a leather cover for my book , because i read tonns of bad reviews about it . so i just found a simple make-up bag i got from estee lauder . it fits my book perfectly and protects it from getting dirty . ; - ) and the price is affordable . im getting this book as a present for my mom this year.so , im glad i got it .

> i was a little hesitant when it came to this cereal . then i thought that a breakfast cereal was , in the grand scheme of life , rather a shallow thing over which to hesitate . cereal should provide nutrients to support my body 'til lunch and that 's that . if i 'm a little wary of cinnamon cereals , oh well.but this is , in my opinion , one of the better cinnamon cereals out there . it 's the perfect amount that does n't overwhelm or leave you wondering just where the cinnamon is . the taste is pleasantly sweet while still maintaining that `` health food '' taste that i happen to love.while i like kashi foods , i never cared too much for the other golean flavors i 've tried . this one hits the spot.as for its nutrition content , i 'm pleased with it and find it to be one of the higher contents of cereals on the market . and yes , a little does go a long way as to feeling satisfied .

> i love it . i watch tv shows and read books and love how colorful it is . great screen . much better than the nook ! i did take off 1 star because the web function is kind of off at times . when i try to click on a website sometimes it will not take and so it is not that sensitive sometimes . also , it will chose different letters than the letters i am typing which is annoying . also , my yahoo email does not work on it . it will not download my messages . so i like it for reading and watching tv shows but do not care for the web and email functions . i did not buy it for that anyway so i still give it 4 stars for the things i like to use it for . i am getting one for my daughter on her birthday and would recommend it .

> i 'm going to go ahead and 5 star this headset . i thought for a minute it had a echo sound , but everything seems good now . i 've walked more than 10 or 20 feet away and it stays connected . it also notifies me when it trying to connect . the voice dialing for the most part works and the music quality is great . no one has complained about not being able to hear me . i do think the little earbuds can sometimes come away from the magnetic holder a little too easy , but i 'm not going to complain too much about that because it really happens when i try to keep the neck band under my shirt . i think this is a great headset and would recommend it . i do n't have any experience with the hb-700 .

> ever since burt 's bees got rid of the lip shimmer line or at least the colors i love , i 've been looking for a product that can come close to replacing it . eureka ! while this product does n't have the menthol effect that burt 's does , it has a lovely color , has so little shimmer that it looks natural during the day and the color is at the perfect 'strength ' . it really looks like my lips but only better . it is not gluey or sticky or overly greasy , like you 've bathed you lips in butter.this spice color seems to be the only one that has a peachy/brick undertones ( or at least it was the only one my store carried . but it is truest spice color i 've found lately , in products like this .

> i rarely leave the house without a hat during the warm and sunny months so i own a lot of hats . i was initially planning to just use this hat when i do yard work , but this hat is so comfortable and offers so much protection that i find myself taking it everywhere.this hat is light weight , dries quickly , and is vented at the crown . the neck loop is convenient and offers some stability if you drive a convertible and you catch a breeze . ditto for when you are on a boat . i bought this in khaki , but all the colors seem neutral friendly.i was initially put off by the price but the fit , quality , comfort , and spf protection makes it a good choice and ultimately a good value .

> this drum is well used in our house . both of my children ( age 3 and 18 months ) enjoy this drum . i particularly like that the drumsticks are attached to the drum so you do n't have loose parts and it is harder to hit siblings with the sticks.music and making music is an important part of growing and learning . it helps develop the brain in different areas . it also helps kids learn pattern , rythm , creativity and more.i am all for toys that are fairly quiet , easy to play with , and creative . i want a toy that will encourage my child to learn and explore the world around him/her . this toy meets most of the items on that list.well worth the money.enjoy .

> the man is a conundrum . that is edward klein 's point , i believe . why does a man step left or right ? that can be a perplexing question . yet , the answer can be broken down into a totally logical thought process . if one could only see into the mind . that is what mr. klein has done here . i would say that edward klein is totally objective in his handling of his analysis and ultimately backs up why we have an armature at the helm . surrounded by incompetent advisers , czars and the like , it is amazing to read klein 's gifted insight , analysis and research for this work . it is another can't-put-it-down book .

> i had enjoyed reading nicholas carr 's cover story in the atlantic titled , `` is google making us stupid ? '' and i was a bit apprehensive that his new book , the shallows : what the internet is doing to our brains , might be nothing more than a ballooning of the earlier essay into a book with nothing new to offer readers . i was pleasantly surprised to find enough new content to satisfy most readers , especially neurological information . i especially liked the interesting digressions that carr placed between chapters . any reader looking to read a book that will stimulate thinking will find satisfaction from these pages.rating : three-star ( recommended )

> this compilation was released in 1997 and contains all their big hits up to that point , as well as containing some songs that were new at the time . i became a fan of brooks and dunn from their very first album , represented here by five songs , all of them huge hits and four of which went to number one on the country charts . the five songs were brand new man , boot scooting boogie , neon moon , lost and found and my next broken heart.just about any song from that debut album could have been a single , something that was also true of their second album . it is also represented by five songs , these being hard working man , that ai n't no way to go , rock my world ( little country girl ) , we 'll burn that bridge and she used to be mine . again , they were all huge country hits.their third album was generally mellower , with more ballads and fewer up-tempo songs . while it was not what i expected at the time , it was a good move on their part to be a little different . four tracks from that album are included here , all huge hits . these were you 're gon na miss me when i 'm gone , she 's not the cheating kind , whiskey under the bridge and little miss honky-tonk.just two tracks represent their fourth album ( my maria and mama do n't get dressed up for nothing ) , but there were more than two hits so the others could be included on a second volume . three songs specially recorded for the album complete the nineteen songs.this is a brilliant collection with plenty of hard-rocking country , but with some wonderful slower songs too .

> `` brazil '' is the first updike book that i 've read . i picked the book at a `` friends of the library '' sale . i enjoyed the world of tristao and isabel . two themes of race and economics seemed most prominent to me . the first is the racial divide between black and white . the world surrounding the two main characters teems with the stereotypical images of poor , lazy , and criminal minority vs. the wealthy and idle who can operate above the law . amidst all this , the love story bobs like a boat on an ocean of incredible barriers . to one who has not been there , the world of brazil painted by updike seemed harsh and exotic . he places the story several decades past . ianopamoko was my favorite of the supporting characters with her aged practical wisdom and devotion to isabel 's children . another theme that weaves within the novel is the difference between physical lovemaking and the emotional attachments . sex becomes a commodity to the poor that is a means of survival more than emotional betrayal . i did n't completely buy this from updike , who seemed to gloss over what for most would have been severe emotional consequences . the magical ceremony where isabel and tristao transform their appearance was an interesting plot device that vividly illustrated what it would be like to walk in another 's shoes . the worst part of the novel for me was the abduction of the children . again , the children seemed treated like a commodity . i did n't understand why their story was not resolved as we came into their later years . i found `` brazil '' interesting , although it does seem to pull in many conflicting directions . enjoy !

> `` la mission '' is a superb small film that draws the audience into the characters and situation . benjamin bratt is the film 's star . he turns in an excellent performance as the macho father who has a very difficult time after learning his son is gay . bratt does an excellent job of teetering between extremes . on one hand , he is a loving father ; on the other , he is a low rider filled with pride and bravado . thrown in to the mix is his struggle with alcoholism and his romantic reawakening with his neighbor lena . it is a replete performance , well worth the admission price . as lena , erika alexander turns in an incredibly powerful performace . we see her as a recovering victim , probably of domestic violence , but also as a strong woman who balances her ideals with compassion . jeremy ray valdez plays che 's son jes . with his mother deceased and his father who spent time in prison , he has found his way in the world , often with the help of his uncle and aunt . he does a good job showing an intelligent young man who does n't quite fit into his own culture . his love interest is jordan , played by max rosenack who does a nice job as the caring young man who sticks by jes ' side through thick and thin . talisa soto also turns in a caring supporting performance as jes ' aunt ana . `` la mission '' is a strong film , probably not perfect , but well worth seeing . while i did n't particularly understand the ending , the film is impressive . enjoy !

> the summer 2004 movie season officially got underway with the release of van helsing . the movie was written by stephen sommers ( the mummy and the mummy returns ) . the film stars hugh jackman ( x-men , x2 ) as van helsing , the famed literary vampire hunter who killed count dracula.unlike the usual interpretations of the character , jackman 's van helsing is n't an aging scholar fighting his last battle . instead , this incarnation of van helsing presents the character as a 19th century james bond crossed with the league of extraordinary gentlemen , who is employed by the vatican as a secret agent to ward off the forces of evil.after the movie 's introductory episode with mr. hyde atop notre dame in pris , van helsing returns to vatican city . his superiors send him to trannsylvania , count dracula 's hunting grounds . for half a century dracula has been living in a symbiotic relationship with the villagers . but dracula has begun killing more and the village is under siege by werewolves . dracula is up to something big and only van helsing can stop him.van helsing is full of plot holes , many of the characters lack development , and there is some really corny dialogue . however , the movie has some amazing special effects and provides some very interesting interpretations of literary and movie characters ( i especially enjoyed the representation of frankenstein ) . the movie is n't meant to be a deep piece of cinema . it 's a movie that does what movies have done since they were first invented : entertain and excite . van helsing is a great piece of mind candy to chew on .

> to be perfectly honest , my copy of fix-it utilities 12 professional sat on a table near my computer for some time . i seriously questioned the wisdom of using it at all . some of the mixed reviews made me nervious . however , while browsing on line , i somehow ended up with some filthy little thing that attached itself to my computer , blocking my access to almost everything , oblivious to the presence of my regular computer protection . the more i fiddled with it , the worse it seemed to get . ( pardon all my `` technical '' explanations . ) however , the fact that i am a computer simpleton only proves the quality of this product.multiple times i ran my regular anti-virus program and re-booted . every time , the malware reappeared . ( and my updates were always done automatically . ) each time , i was told that my computer was protected ! nonsense . i promise you , i was certain that i would have to bring it into the shop -- it was sure to cost me at least $ 100.00.as per the very easy instructions , i deleted my regular protection , installed fix-it utilities 12 professional and after only a few minutes , the problem was fixed ! the absolute best part is that i had the use of clearly written instructions in an included paperback book . without that , i would never have been able to get past whatever was was blocking normal operation.well , this simpleton is convinced . if i was able to use it with such spectacular results , imagine what it can do for you !

> i 'm very pleased with this repeater not only for its performance but also with regard to the setup . it 's very straightforward to set up without having to deal with many ( or really any ) of the nitty-gritty technical details of the router . the included installation instructions are brief but clear , and step you through the process . total install time was less than 10 minutes.the unit plugs into the wall outlet and , while it is pretty compact , it does block the second outlet somewhat . but , that 's a small price to pay for wifi signal extension.like most repeaters , your network must support wpa encryption and have a visible ssid ( e.g. , the network name must be visible rather than hidden ) .i 'm using this in the basement to help eliminate dead zones . i put it at the base of the stairs where the signal from my router is the strongest , and it rebroadcasts the signal to cover pretty much the entire basement . before putting in the repeater i would get 1 ( or maybe 2 bars ) signal strength on my tablet . with the repeater i 'm at 5 bars most of the time , and never less than 4 bars regardless of where i am in the basement . that makes a world of difference when streaming video.zero complaints as to performance or installation ease . highly recommend !

> this book has an excellent premise and a very interesting storyline . while there were large sections of this book that brought me much enjoyment , there were also places where i felt it lagged a little and could have been shortened a bit.the characters held my attention and all throughout this book i was curious about what would come of the information presented in the prologue . this kept me reading even through some of the parts that i did not enjoy as much.i found that after getting to the halfway point in this story that it moved pretty quickly after that and the author seemed to have found a good rhythm that made the pages turn much faster . i would say if you are struggling a little with the first half of this book that you should keep going . it will be worth it in the end . the end of the book is also very well handled.the magic in this story was done well and the romance was a bit different than the average . the romance was where i found the most originality in this story . i thought it worked well for the personality and descriptions of the characters.overall this was a pretty enjoyable read that i would recommend to others who are fans of the genre.this review is based on a digital arc from the publisher and provided by netgalley .

> for svirtuosic playing and excellent sound , i agree with the reviewer who picks this version of the shostakovich edition ( working from mussorgsky 's original orchestration ) and the karajan for rimsky-korsakov 's more `` civilzed '' reorchestration . i think we 're past the time when only one or the other can be approved ; each is wonderful in its own way.i just wanted to add that in theater tradition boris is an agonized , guilty monster , a czar who used murder to gain his throne . he attracts sympathy through overt suffering , not for any sympathetic quality other than love of his son . to portray this agony is essential , and it is almost impossible to overplay it so far as russian audiences are concerned . even the scenery-chewing boris christoff , who practically gets hysterical in the clock and death scenes , is actually right in line . abbado 's boris , the estimable anatoly kotcherga , i find rather cool and restrained when it comes to guilt-ridden agony , but the overall cast is so good -- especially dmitri and marina , who tend to be awful on soviet recordings -- that i agree wholeheartedly with the amazon reviewer . this is a boris to live with for a long time to come .

> author david allen lists 52 basic principles for productivity , including : write everything down , do the jobs that nag you , focus on the matter at hand and so on . as he notes , the principles are both simple to understand and difficult to implement . the book is essentially a collection of gleanings from the author 's previous writings , so it does not present a systematic or unified approach to time and productivity management . however , allen 's straightforward tips are handy , if sometimes duplicative . the number 52 suggests that you might find one helpful tip to use each week in a one-year program of self-improvement and productivity management . in that case , repetition is probably a good thing , since bad habits tend to spring up again like weeds and require the same remedies often . the author is relentlessly upbeat , optimistic and witty , like a motivational speaker . that might be hard to read in a big chunk , but it is easy to digest if you spend a little time every week reading a recommendation and implementing it . we recommend this book to anyone who urgently needs help with time management and productivity .

> i figure this might be one of those items you buy on amazon.com that works great for other customers , but not so great for you - depending on the device you 're using it for . i use it to charge a samsung focus phone , and while it does charge alright , the micro usb connector slips out or slightly dislodges very easily . if i accidentally touch or brush past the cable , most of the time the phone ceases to charge for just a moment , and then goes back to charging . but sometimes the connector loses connection more permanently if the cable is disturbed . in the month that i 've had this cable , i 've woken up to an uncharged phone in the morning only once . the phone does charge without losing contact with other cables that i use.pros : - high quality cable material for the price- functional packaging , reliable deliverycons : - micro usb connector can lose contact easily . i think this might have something to do with the fact that the prongs on the underside of the micro usb connector are not prominent enough

> i recently returned the newly designed friction mount and bought this one . i am definitely glad i did . on the new model , it clearly leaves an imprint/residue on your dash . it is weird because you ca n't feel the residue but you can definitely see it . the newer mount is also moldable but not enough to go on areas of your dash near curves and vents . the new model did not feel secure at all on the left side of my dash.for this model ( the older style ) , it is simple but works well . it does n't move when driving fast or making fast turns . it does n't leave a residue . it fits on the left side of my dash just fine . the base is larger than expected so it is not very foldable in regards to storage . however , the bags move enough to where it fits nicely in the upper compartment of my dash . the mount does n't fold down but it is easy to detach .

( spoiler alert ) her & # 34 ; characters & # 34 ; are different cloned versions which have grown up totally separate from each other.the story begins rather vaguely , following one of the characters , sarah , leading a down-and-out life , and who , due to a bizarre incident , begins to assume the life of one of the other clones ( beth , a police detective ) . things were so hazy at first that i was n't able to initially identify where the story was taking place ( toronto ) . but , trust me , after a couple of episodes , the main framework of the story comes into clearer focus , with all the main and supporting characters in place , and & # 34 ; orphan black & # 34 ; really begins to rock . toronto , which is often used by u.s. film companies as a less expensive stand-in for new york , l.a. , or boston , here looks like ... .camden . this is supposed to reflect sarah 's grubby life , i guess , but it mainly comes off as cheap . this is n't your canada of the pristine wilderness of alberta or manitoba , but urban canada , which is kind of ... .vanilla.though one of the characters is a young scientist , season 1 gets into the science of cloning hardly at all , deleting the need for any science related special effects and staying centered on being a fast-paced paranoia-based thriller . however , season 2 may well delve more into the science , and have more special effects .

> neal stephenson asks a lot from readers of his latest thousand-page novel , anathem . he asks that we adapt to his made-up terminology quickly , and stay with him as he expands our new vocabulary quickly . i expect many readers will tire of this quickly , and become frustrated . the glossary helps . using that terminology , he creates an earth-like world he calls arbre , and proceeds to inhabit that world with groups of people that we must come to know and understand . on top of that , he presents science in ways that will engage some readers , and alienate others . beyond all that , he has his characters engage in philosophical exercises that keep even the most engaged readers alert in trying to remain focused . the reward for readers who take on this challenge is immersion into a world that stimulates thinking about our human condition and the decisions we make to resolve our frustrations . the vast size of the book allows stephenson plenty of space in which he can develop characters , which he does well here , and to explore ideas , which he also does with great skill . my understanding evolved as i continued to read , and i came away from anathem with the pleasure of having conquered a complicated novel and with respect for the author who pulled all the threads together with great skill . had stephenson been able to achieve this using three or four hundred fewer pages , i would have added another star or two to my rating.rating : three-star ( recommended )

> the tragedy paper is another young adult novel set at an upscale boarding school where kids `` come of age '' through some type of poor decision making that leads to tragedy . the book has several nods to shakespeare including that one main character is tim macbeth and another has the first name duncan . the school is full of traditions and one important to the plot is that each graduating senior leaves a `` treasure '' for the student who will next occupy his room . tim , an albino , who only attended the school for the second semester of his senior year leaves cds for duncan who `` inherits '' the room . the cds tell the story of tim 's short time there , the history of his relationship with a girl named vanessa , and what happened during his class 's fateful senior game . the senior game being another of the school 's traditions that connect the different graduating classes . meanwhile duncan has his own problems preparing for his own senior game as well as interest in a girl - daisy.this book does not have the four letter words so many novels seem to feel they are required to include which may make the tragedy paper more attractive to some librarians and teachers . otherwise it is a pretty typical young adult novel with some romance , suspense and learning from mistakes .

> this film has an almost angelic and spiritual look about it . john wayne gives one of his best performances as dan roman a man who relives a tragic past as an airline pilot . dimitri tiomkin 's score is truly angelic and the musical refrain that wayne whistles throughout is haunting to this day . director william `` wild bill '' wellman a veteran world war i flyer turns in a monumentally suspenseful and emotionally charged adventure . robert stack , forever cautiously stoic , and jan sterling in an emotionally moving role give excellent performances . the cinematography is breathtaking , ominous yet calming giving one the impression that faith and the best qualities of man will persevere . this is classic filmmaking . this two-disc edition is really well worth your time . it is both informative and extremely interesting . there are no fillers here . the extras on dimitri tiomkin , william wellman , the restoration of the high and the mighty ( which by the way is outstanding and impressive ) and john wayne 's batjac story and other extras are all remarkable and well thought out and presented . i truly enjoy this dvd edition and found it to be a required addition to my collection .

> my first amanda kyle williams book . this book was well written and easy to read and follow . i was able to get into it very quickly and submerged myself into the south of atlanta , georgia within a few pages.i wo n't regurgitate the story as you can read it in the publisher 's notes . keye street is a pi , but this book reads like a police procedural with the investigation going in steady steps to identify and nab the culprit . the characters were easy to like , the story was easy to follow . there was n't much edge of the seat excitement , but i did n't miss it . i enjoyed the company of the characters , following them in the book . there was a lot of humor and there was a romance , but it was n't obtrusive and annoying and it segued cleanly with the story.overall , i enjoyed this book very much and i will definitely read ms. william 's other books .

> this , like the other books in the series was extremely well written - the story beautifully told . having said that , there 's a direction that the plot takes that i would have preferred that it did not ( i liked how the burn notice tv series ended much better ) , but the story was still told extremely well . having said that , now that i have read the entire series , i do n't have a lot of motivation to re-read and re-experience the ending - maybe that will change with time . my greatest critisizm of the book is how the emotions of the two main characters are portrayed - their feelings were handled the same way . this makes sense when it comes to tris , but not for four . overall , great series and book . much better read than hunger games - huge difference in quality of writing .

> robin williams is known for his comedic roles , and this is definitely a movie that shows that , albeit with a spin , since he must disguise himself as a woman to be able to spend time with his children ( hired by his ex-wife as their nanny ) after his divorce . ex-wife is angry with him because he is immature ( well ... he is ) and she does n't want his negative influence on the kids.however , he learns some maturity as he assumes the role of mrs. doubtfire , since he must control himself and not slip up and accidentally reveal himself to his ex-wife or kids ( interesting situation to be sure ) overall an enjoyable film .

> keith richards was nearly a stone alone at the celebrations of chuck berry 's 60th birthday.the concerts were held in the fox theatre - st. louis , missouri - on october 6 , 1986 , and berry park - wentzville - on october 16. the 13 songs from the shows clock in at slightly over 39 minutes.a documentary chronicled the oftentimes fractious relationship between richards - who put together the band & produced the cd - and berry , which found the latter threatening several times on camera to abandon the project.the years leading to the shows found berry mostly backed by local musicians who had no practice time before taking the stage . that is one of the reasons why richards stepped in and brought together an all-star band for the event , which included johnnie johnson , who was a long-time pianist with berry.the other band members are richards ( guitar ) , chuck leavell ( piano ) , bobby keys ( sax ) , joey sampinato ( bass ) , steve jordan ( drums ) and ingrid berry ( vocals ) . the guests made the shows very special , as the legendary etta james brought the house down on rock and roll music . linda ronstadt ( back in the usa ) and julian lennon ( johnny b. goode ) also delivered outstanding vocal performances.eric clapton ( guitar , vocals ) is drenched in the blues on wee wee hours , one of the first tracks berry recorded for chess records - and the b-side to his first hit , maybellene . but it 's robert cray ( guitar , vocals ) on brown-eyed handsome man that remains my favorite cut.other songs that appear on the cd include around and around - the rolling stones have a great cover of it on love you live - maybellene and memphis , tennessee.berry is rock-n-roll and these performances demonstrate the reason why .

> we bought a blue mp3 player for ds . he is too young to have an expensive nor complex player , but let 's face it , the cd player and all the discs started to take up too much room.the reason we picked it , aside from the low price , was the sd card slot.i do not like to plug things to my computer and i do not want to have the computer 's memory all used up by hundreds of albums.i own a fancier player , also with sd card and i love it and now that ds has used his player i do not regret.we have not used the internal memory yet , so far we have only used the sd card to store all this.we figure that if the machine breaks down , at least we will not lose everything.the player is still going strong , but i still love the reasoning.on a 4gb card ( if you do not use the card , then read that you could do just as good on the player 's memory ) , i was able to store all of his albums ( total 647 songs ) and many audiobooks ( at least 16 audiobooks that i can remember ) i was not sure ds could use it on his own at first ( he was 6 ) but the menu is that easy ! you turn on , select music and pick . or select audiobook and select . wow.we have used the unit with boombox speaker system and with simple computer speakers . the quality of sound is very good . we live in a big house , but we can hear very nicely.that player has been dropped many times but does not show any sign.love it !

> i normally use oil of olay complete as a facial moisturizer . it comes with spf 15 sunscreen , which i view as an added plus . this cetaphil facial moisturizer has spf 50. wow . i could n't wait to try it.out of the box , i was a little disappointed . the tube is very small . 1.7 ounces is not much . the lotion is thick , but not unpleasantly so . what is unpleasant is it smells like sunscreen . upon applying , i felt a heaviness , though it was n't greasy nor sticky . i did n't have the problem of the moisturizer flaking off like i do with most facial moisturizers containing sunscreen , although i did n't wear makeup over it , which is when that problem is most visible.i suppose it 's hard to disguise an spf 50 sunscreen . i would definitely classify this as a sunscreen with moisturizer rather than a moisturizer with sunscreen , if you know what i mean . i 'd gladly wear it for days spent out in the sun , but as an everyday moisturizer , i 'll stick with oil of olay complete .

> before starting to watch this series with my wife i always thought i it would n't interest me at all but i was completely wrong . i thought the show was simple about a rich aristocratic family but it 's so much more , and has far more depth then i could have imagined.through the family , the servants surrounding areas you see the changes that take place , not just to the family but also those working for them and even society as a whole . in addition seeing people adapt to technologic changes during that time period , ranging from electricity , phones and even cars , is very enlightening and interesting .
= i would have never thought i 'd like it

> i 've been a big fan of eneloop batteries for some time now , and amazon seems to put this particular pack on sale pretty often.if you see it on sale , do n't hesitate . more likely than not , the price will be as much or less than the batteries alone , and you get a charger and case.otherwise , i 'd hold off for a sale , because the charger is slow overnight ( 7 - 10 hours ) model , and the plastic clips on the case are so chintzy , they snapped off after a handful of uses.the batteries , though ... pretty great .
= only get this when it 's on sale .
< great batteries , but not great

> good sense at a sensible price.comparable active ingredient to brand name migraine otc products but costs a lot less.as someone who has had migraines for years finding what works can be a lot of trial and error with lots of frustrations.this is an effective product . as the label states be careful not to & # 34 ; over use & # 34 ; as using too frequently can lead to rebound headaches ( one of my greatest fears ) . i use this to treat moderate migraines leaving my prescriptions for the severe migraines.i 've used multiple good sense products and have been very happy with them .

> after losing my previous tumbler , i was looking for an insulated and no-spill one , and this one responded to my needs . i like the size and colour ( green ) . i personally just wished it had some sort of side handle , as i am used to drink coffee in mugs and my previous tumbler had a handle . i almost feel like i do not have enough grip on it at times , but then if it slips , since it 's no-spill , i guess it 's not a big deal .

> & quot ; strange behaviour , & quot ; whose title is lifted from the lyric of the 1986 single & quot ; skin trade , & quot ; is the first career-spanning remix album from duran duran . i already own many of these 12-inch mixes on vinyl , but it 's convenient to have them all on two cds . the first disc , which covers the years 1981-84 , is classic duran duran , featuring & quot ; night & quot ; versions of the hits & quot ; girls on film , & quot ; the original mix of & quot ; my own way , & quot ; and & quot ; hungry like the wolf. & quot ; there 's also a version of & quot ; planet earth , & quot ; that i have n't heard before and is different from the one i own on the 1981 12-inch single . other notable tracks are extended versions of & quot ; union of the snake & quot ; and & quot ; new moon on monday , & quot ; although i 'm no huge fan of the 12 version of & quot ; the reflex , & quot ; which verges on annoying . while the first disc is automatically a keeper , the second disc , which covers the years 1986-93 , is where things get patchy . i ca n't deny the excellent mixes of the nile rogers-produced & quot ; notorious & quot ; and & quot ; skin trade , & quot ; and i also dig & quot ; i do n't want your love & quot ; and & quot ; all she wants is. & quot ; however , & quot ; strange behaviour & quot ; runs into a few clunkers such as the sluggish remix of & quot ; violence of summer , & quot ; and bland remixes of & quot ; love voodoo & quot ; and & quot ; none of the above. & quot ; even so , this double-disc set is a recommended purchase for durannies who want a one-stop collection of the band 's 12 mixes .

> some of the criticism of `` the 6th day '' centers on the undeniable fact that we 've seen a bit of the main character , adam gibson , before . was `` 6th day '' cloned from stuff `` total recall '' left on the cutting room floor ? well , aside from the always-appealing plot theme of `` who am i , really '' which is also in `` total recall '' , i have to say , no , this is a good , mostly original and enjoyable science fiction thriller.and thrilling it certainly was . though some of the thematic material is somewhat derivative if you are a sci-fi buff , this movie delivers a goodly amount of suspense and turn-around surprises . it is n't the smartest plot in the dvd deck ; i found some of the scenes predictable and there was one deplorable and totally gratuitous car chase early in the film . ( grrrrr i hate gratuitous car chases . ) and later on , there is a matrix-cloned scene involving another type of transportation , but i wo n't put any spoilers in here and tell you about it . but it 's why i nicked this a star and rated it four and not five.however , if you can shut an eye to the vehicular filmicide , you may enjoy a reasonably fast-paced , very suspenseful film with a good supporting cast , too.schwarzenegger has been quoted as saying he believes in delivering plenty of good entertainment value for the filmgoer 's dollar , as in `` terminator 2 '' -- a big favorite . he is a man of his word . `` the 6th day '' has lots of good stuff -- thrills , suspense , special effects . it 's fine science fiction and lots of fun .
= maybe it 's cloned from previous arnold films , but enjoyable
< good science fiction

> there are sixteen tracks here covering all aspects of christmas , with a well-balanced mix of original or obscure songs and familiar standards . the booklet includes the lyrics for most of the songs including all the unfamiliar material . you probably know the words to the songs for which lyrics are omitted.taking the standards first , they are blue christmas ( featuring diana krall on piano ) , o holy night , ave maria , o come all ye faithful , the christmas song , brahms lullaby ( although this classical piece does n't appear often on mainstream christmas albums ) , happy xmas war is over ( the john lennon classic ) and feliz navidad ( the jose feliciano classic ) . suffice to say that celine 's versions are of a high quality and stand comparison with the many other recorded versions of these songs.the remaining songs are do n't save it all for christmas day ( co-written by celine ) , another year has gone by ( co-written by bryan adams ) , the magic of christmas day , the prayer ( a duet with andrea bocelli ) , christmas eve , the title track ( a dianne warren song ) , i 'm your angel ( a duet with r kelly , who wrote the song ) and les cloches des hameau ( a brahms song that is somewhat less famous than his lullaby ) .this album has been a popular choice among christmas music buyers ever since its original release in 1998 and it 's not difficult to see why . it is my first celine dion album , but it certainly wo n't be my last .

> i was delighted when the lovin ' spoonful was inducted into the rock & roll hall of fame in 2000. sadly , they did not get the rave welcoming that i hoped they would . i also hoped this induction would spark an even greater interest in their music . their music was fun , feel good , gentle and just a pleasant foil to the more `` heavy '' or intense music of the day dealing with topical and heavily emotional themes . the lovin ' spoonful are without a doubt one of the best sixties bands and clearly a band to remain unforgotten for time immemorial.this extraordinary band was skilled at moving from folk to rock to country to psychedlia to rock . they showed a real facility for incorporating different musical styles and creating an original and delightful product.the anthology is always worth listening to and is in general a must have . songs from 1966-1968 are included and the different musical styles can be followed in a temporal progression . head spoonful john sebastian 's input makes a good thing even better . his liner notes not only add information , but keep that spark of interested ignited and listeners wanting more . `` what a good day for a daydream ...

> the emancipation of mimi finds mariah carey coming back strong and returning to her mid 1990 's glory . ms. carey 's voice is in first rate form and the song selections fit her style . the album starts off on the wrong foot with the jermaine dupri produced `` it 's like that '' , but rebounds nicely with the strong threesome , the megahit `` we belong together '' , the follow-up hit `` shake it off '' , which even better than its predecessor and the even better still , `` mine again '' which has a sleek & sexy neosoul groove . it would n't be a mariah carey album without a guest rapper and snoop dogg shows up on the solid `` say somethin ' '' . the best track on the album is silky `` i wish you knew '' which has tight production , punchy horns and a powerful , but not overstated vocal . the album has shown that ms. carey can once again be a major commercial force .

> police academy ( 20th anniversary special edition ) ~ g.w . bailey is the only good movie of them all . guttenberg plays an amazing role , and the script is not as paper thinn as the rest of the sequells . this makes the rest of movies look look the winner of the nobel prize . the dialogue is not as horrid as the later sequells either but is kind of well developed . i love tackleberry the vietnam craze and all the other steroetypical charachters in this movie . i also love the blue eyester bar scene . the rest of the movie is filled with typical 80 's stereotypical view of society which was normal at the time . it is also a time capsule for the music ( frankie goes to hollywood is played in one scene ) , the fashion ( the tacky clothes ) and everything else that was like `` in fashion '' during the 80 's . highly recommended indeed .

'' so on saturday , he eats a bunch , and i mean a bunch of junk and gets sick that evening . no wonder ! mixing salami with a lollipop , cake , ice cream and watermelon just does n't make for a great outcome . but on sunday , he eats another green leaf and feels much better . i think that says a lot about how important it is to eat good things . it 's also fun to see how many of the colorful things the catepillar ate wind up as the color of his wings . my little one enjoys this book and we read it quite often . a classic .

> first , you may wish to read too many cooks , before this book , but this book can still be a stand alone . a romance between a black man and a white woman seems normal today , but when this book was published , 1964 , this book was dealing with hot and dangerous stuff . marriage , murder and race is n't something to laugh at in those days . not today either , when you come right down to it . i think rex stout did a fairly good job . archie goodwin and nero wolfe come out as humane and willing to do their best for the whipple family in their hour of need .

> my introduction to techno/electronica music arrived with the chemical brothers `` exit planet dust '' cd . i read the review in `` rolling stone , '' liked what i read , purchased the disc and loved it from the first play . since then i 've aquired `` dig your own hole , '' `` surrender '' and `` come with us . '' all are excellent albums but my favorite is the latter . i 'm not sure exactly why . maybe the last aquired is my favorite because i 'm just a little burned out by playing the others so much . `` come with us '' is a terrific album . usually i like to note the best songs first and then get down to the ones i care the least about . well , let 's reverse it on this one . i do n't particularly care for chemical brothers songs having extensive vocals . thus `` the state we 're in '' and `` the test '' are my least favored tunes on this disc . they are n't bad songs ; i just do n't care for them as much as the others . having said this , all other tracks on this disc are incredibly good . wonderful dance music ! complex polyrhythyms are intricately interwoven with wonderfully hooky melodic lines on all songs . the best way to listen and appreciate the music , of course , is by dancing to it . and what an experience that can be ! i 'm unable to choose a favorite selection . perhaps `` come with us , '' `` it began in africa , '' `` star guitar '' or `` my elastic eye '' might garner my vote , but `` galaxy bounce , '' `` hoops , '' `` denmark '' and `` pioneer skies '' would n't be far behind . now , if i could just get rid of those two tracks with vocals and perhaps add a couple such as `` it does n't matter '' and `` lost in the k-hole '' from the `` dig your own hole '' disc , i 'd have a perfect chemical brothers cd.gary peterson

> george 's voice has a limited range but is very easy on the ear . he first achieved fame with the american top five hit , a rose and a baby ruth , which sold a million . george was immediately cast as a teen idol and went on tour with various rock'n'roll singers including buddy holly , gene vincent and the everly brothers . this allowed george to earn a good living but it was n't the kind of music that he wanted to do . in the sixties , george achieved some success on the american country charts , notably with abilene , break my mind and canadian pacific , without becoming a really big star . george spent a lot of time touring other countries including britain and canada , helping to increase the popularity of country music in those countries.george was a regular visitor to canada and came to appreciate canadian songwriters , especially gordon lightfoot , frequently covering their songs . on this compilation , you will find several of george 's covers of such songs . as an international singer with only limited success in his own country , george recorded many covers.this compilation includes his biggest american hits ( a rose and a baby ruth , abilene , break my mind , canadian pacific ) together with covers of early morning rain , steel rail blues ( both gordon lightfoot ) , i 'm gon na be a country boy again ( buffy sainte-marie ) , both sides now ( joni mitchell ) , streets of london ( ralph mctell ) , everything is beautiful ( ray stevens ) and crystal chandeliers ( charley pride ) . the last named song is charley pride 's signature song outside the usa , yet was not even released as a single in his own country . there are plenty of other good songs - a total of 22 in all.george is less well known in his own country than he is elsewhere in the world but this compilation contains a representative selection of his music .

> now , if you use a mac , you should probably just switch to windows since this ( and millions of other great products ) wo n't play well with apple 's closed-architecture . ( maybe their upcoming switch to intel will help , but then , maybe not . ) windows users , rejoice . this pure plug-and-play portable external hard drive from western digital is very easy to install and use . in fact you do n't install anything : just plug into a usb 2.0 ( or usb 1.1 ) port and go . like most drives , this is best at writing and reading large files , so do n't get frustrated if you find the speed lacking when you transfer a large batch of small files ( e.g. , millions of small jpeg or mp3 files ) .this compact , palm-sized drive is stylish . it 's also quiet in operation . i like its look and feel better than its competition from seagate ( although i *am* a huge fan of seagate 's desktop hard drives ) . ignore the mac-using naysayers on this forum : if you have a pc , you will do fine .

> actually , i have been a long-time fan of this series , and having enjoyed all the books in the series , some more than others , i decided it was high time i put down my thoughts of each book.in `` industrial magic '' , paige winterbourne returns , finding herself a pariah of sorts after having been abandoned by her coven . her attempts to set up a new coven are not going well , due primarily to her romantic affiliation with lucas cortez , a sorcerer , and also being the guardian of fledgling teen witch savannah.lucas is the illegitimate beloved son of the leader of the powerful cortez cabal , and when his dad enlists lucas ' and paige 's help to solve the mysterious disappearances and deaths of children of powerful cabals , the pair find themselves enmeshed in a complex and dangerous world inhabited by all sorts of supernatural beings . some familiar characters from earlier novels in the series make their appearance here , but there are also new characters to keep the story fresh and intriguing . the women of the otherworld series of books is one of my favorite supernatural series [ alongside the sookie stackhouse mysteries and the st germain series ] and ms armstrong 's tautly-plotted stories and well-developed characterizations keep readers engaged and coming back for more . highly recommended for fans of the genre .

> i bought this otterbox commuter series because my otterbox defender series was rendered useless by apples ' ios7 update.however , this case is so frustrating to install i wish i had not bought it in the first place.frustration # 1 : the screen shield was totally ruined by the little stickers otterbox attached to the shield to tell you not to touch the surface of the shield . when you removed the stickers they left residue on the shield that i could not clean completely off making the shield unusable.frustration # 2 : trying to fit the phone ( with the rubber outer skin ) back into the hard plastic outer case and have the rubber maintain its shape and seal quality around edges of the phone ! frustration # 3 : given the quality and protection that i thought i was buying and the quality and protection i was left with i would have been better off ( and a little richer , at the end of the day ) if had bought one the the cases for less than a dollar.in all honesty i can not recommend this product !

> our baby ( 11-months-old ) is now on solid foods and we try to feed him a great variety of items . the doctor said he could eat the same foods we eat . well , that 's good to know but we need a things that are easier to eat . in part , we make up concoctions of our own dishes but reduced to a mush . in addition , my wife found this earth 's best organic line of baby foods at a local store . they have quite a lineup of foods , but the brand and all varieties can be a little hard to find.one thing he seems to like are fruit and grain mixtures , so we picked up a variety pact as well as individual jars and we include a jar in his daily intake . my wife likes the organic aspect with no preservatives or additives and the baby seems to enjoy the foods . we 're gradually trying more and more of the earth 's best organic lines of food , and we 've been very satisfied so far.gary peterson

> it 's such a beautiful and magical story ! ! it reminds me a lot of another one of my favorite books , the orphan 's tales : in the night gardenby catherynne m. valente . riggs shares a certain amount of her style - with his use of lush vocabulary and use of magic . though technically this book falls under the young adult genre , its elevated vocabulary may intimidate younger readers in the genre - or maybe inspire them to expand their own knowledge , but there is nothing inappropriate for readers in these pages . it 's simple a wonderful story with great imagery - both actual and metaphorical . though the photographs do add significantly to the story , they are so well described in the text , they feel familiar before you even view them ! and with an ending like that - i am crossing my fingers that the wait for the sequel wo n't be too terribly long ! !
= i absolutely love this book !
< a beautiful and magical story !

> `` cars '' was an entertaining animated feature . the story line about a racecar that is stranded in radiator springs was well written . the moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to . owen wilson 's voice is so good as lightning mcqueen that you actually feel like it 's a living character . as big a fan as i am of bonnie hunt , i actually did n't realize it was her voice as sally the porche until afterwards . paul newman does an excellent job as the former piston cup winner doc hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races . i enjoyed this movie far more than i 'd anticipated i would . it 's a heart-warming tale . enjoy !

> relative danger has a good plot , fascinating settings , believable dialog , and a sense of humor . like most novels , it has it weaknesses , but i was able to overlook all but 2. one is major , and that 's the protagonist , doug . he seems to be 30-something , but a more hapless , dopey character would be hard to find . if i were from pennsylvania , i 'd be insulted by the depiction of doug 's hometown as a boring backwater full of dull nobodies . doug is likeable enough , but seems never to have picked up a book in his life , and is as gullible as a 6 year old.my 2nd complaint is minor , about the forced cleverness that pops up every chapter or so.relative danger is worth finishing as a fast paced , easy romp that borders upon `` cozy .

> this product is now ranked number 1 nationwide and yes , it really is worth trying ! i can spray this stuff on cat emesis and voila ! let it dry and sweep it up ( but i do have a high-powered vacuum ) . got ta love that no scrubbing up vomite ! with two long-haired persians in the house , this stuff is completely indispensable . one of them in particularly , since she is a rescue cat , has been beaten so vomits rather regularly . however , even if it 's in an out-of-the-way place and i do n't find it for days afterwards , this product still gets up the stain without any trouble whatsoever . i have gone through a bottle a month , no kidding , during shedding time and just used it tonight . ca n't be without this one . highly , highly recommend !

> seeing as how `` rockin ' the suburbs '' remains my favorite ben folds/ben folds five album , i thought about giving this a mere 4 stars , but in retrospect -- - and after playing this cd again recently -- - i think it warrants 5 stars . pretty much close to brilliance , both musically and lyrically . in the case of those lyrics , this time around mr. folds really sheds some emotional layers and digs deep . he 's still funny at times , but on this album he also touches other emotions . as usual , the songs run the gamut from frisky pop tunes with lyrics that will make you laugh or smile , to tender tunes that might even make you a bit misty-eyed . so yeah , this album covers all the bases . another very satisfying album from a true pop genius .
= close to brilliance
< a pop genius

> even though it 's understandable that priest fans would hate this album , because after all it is a softer and more commercial album , there are three fantastic songs on this bad boy . those would be `` turbo lover '' `` locked in '' and `` reckless '' . very melodic and good songs . the rest of the album has some above average bits here and there , but mostly forgettable.i have to admire this album because it takes me back to my childhood in the mid 80 's . the loud guitars remind me of my parents driving me around on back roads back then . sometimes memories can help improve an albums quality . also , to the albums defense , it 's still quite heavy .
= weak , but the good is great
< softer and more commercial

> based on the description and the reviews i purchased this , and i am very glad i did . i am not a fan of mounting things permanently to my car , and i really wanted something that could transfer to another vehicle easily -- this little stand does the trick nicely.i was truly amazed how this thing stood in place no matter how steep the slope on the dashboard and no matter how quickly you turn . i 'm sure it is possible to knock it over , but it sure is n't easy ! i definitely would recommend this to anyone as it is affordable , quickly set up , dependable , and easily tucked out of sight when parked . 6 stars on this one .
= fantastic mount !
< great for the price

> this is my second e-reader , so a step up from my simple kindle , which i sent on to a friend . it 's more difficult to figure out , with more bells and whistles that do n't impress me . except for the lighted screen , which i can read in the dark and not keep my husband awake , i 'm not thrilled with the rest of the & # 34 ; improvements. & # 34 ; still , now that i 've completed the bell curve , i like it and read it as much as i did my old one -- but sometimes i do miss my old one .

> received my headphones after i returned a less expensive blue tooth headset i bought from a local vendor . i was happy with the look and the fell , paired easily with my tablet and galaxy s4 great sound from either source and tested if it would loose signal if i moved . no dropout at 40 ' or in a room without line of sight . one great feature it has is it can be linked to 2 devices at the same time so if i am watching a movie on my tablet i can still send and receive calls through my cell .
= great sound and holds signal , no noise or dropout

> samsung 52 '' lcd . its a big tv and the bracket looked flimsy and weak ( i am a mechanical engineer ) when i unpacked it . but when it was installed , and had the structural support of the wall - obviously the mounting screws have to go into the studs- the bracket was firm and totally fit for purpose . it had all the necessary combination of hardware , so nothing else ( apart from simple tools ) were needed . i would buy this again and highly recommend it .
= feels light but does the work - easily

> the last kindle fire i bought was the original - this is such an improvement , it 's astounding.first , the screen - absolutely gorgeous.the speed - it 's got a snapdragon 800 , so it 's as fast as you 're going to get , for the moment.of course , the content is great . i do wish that it was a google-certified device , but that 's the trade-off . i 'd buy a kindle fire every time , since it 's such a high-quality device .
= a significant improvement !

> i bought this headset because people on conference calls were complaining that they heard an echo when i talked with my wired headset . a friend recommended this , and i ordered on his recommendation . with my iphone 4s and this headset , there is still an echo when i talk . the manual mentions aptx technology , which the iphone does n't support . i do n't recommend buying this if you are an iphone user . i am returning it .

> as an adult i enjoy game nights way too much ! and this game is not making things better . up to the point when i played this game for the first time my favorite one was taboo , but for drunken adult nights card against humanity is a much better match ! the numerous inappropriate combinations that come out as a result are going to be remembered by your friends long after the game was played . great fun !
= perfect for adult game nights

> it 's possible to get excited about scissors when they 're as good as these . they have a good grip that 's equal for right-handers and left-handers . the shearing action between the tangs ( blades ) is quite effective on light use items such as paper . the pivot is unusually tight and the non-stick titanium material is an improvement over most scissors . these scissors are definitely not made for heavy use .
= equal right or left-handed ; sharp ; light-weight ; tight pivot

> i was reluctant to purchase one of these obvious knock off cables , but the loss of my household 's only ipod cable necessitated it . mine was from generic and it works just as well as the old one for a tenth the price of an apple replacement , though read a lot of reviews and make sure amazon does not automatically partner you with a less trustworthy dealer of cheap knock-offs .

> i do find the buttons are a bit hard to find at first , but once you get used to it , it is fine . it is so light and small easily fits into my purse , but i ca n't wait for my case to arrive so it will feel more like a book , and hold some cards . i may be able to stop carrying my big purse

> we are finally treated to the & quot ; essential & quot ; billy joel compilation , making excellent use of the 75 min . per cd . this 36 track 2-cd set all but makes the previous greatest hits sets ( vol . 1-2-3 ) superfluous.the interesting thing about this set is that it comes 6 months after the uk issued their & quot ; ultimate & quot ; billy joel 2-cd compilation . the uk and us sets ( which are , at the current exchange rate , priced pretty much the same ) , mostly overlap , although the track sequencing differs greatly . if you can not live without & quot ; all for leyna & quot ; , & quot ; this is the time & quot ; , & quot ; streetlife serenader & quot ; , & quot ; modern woman & quot ; or a few other choice cuts on your & quot ; ultimate bj & quot ; then i suggest you switch to amazon.co.uk and get the uk & quot ; ultimate & quot ; version . conversely , the uk set does not contain tracks like & quot ; only the good die young & quot ; , & quot ; lullbye & quot ; , & quot ; and so it goes & quot ; , and a few others that you will find only on the us & quot ; essential & quot ; set.this is the best of all worlds : compare which one suits you better , and everyone wins . either way , though , this is an excellent update of & quot ; the best of & quot ; billy joel on one cd set . when you hear these tracks one after another , it is truly amazing how many winning songs the & quot ; piano man & quot ; has written over the years . here 's wishing that bj has a few more up his sleeve ...

> you know there 's really only one reason i 'd ever give a negative review for something so small and minor such as pot holders , and you can probably guess what that reason is- these things are too thin . the heat can easily absorb into the pot holders and eventually , within 5 seconds , onto your tender skin ! this is a serious problem my friends . it means you have to use at least two sets of pot holders for one thing , and well , i 've pretty much adjusted to using two sets at a time ( by placing one over the other of course ) but this is honestly flat out ridiculous . i should n't have to do this at all.the other problem is that , unless you 're someone who can keep your pot holders nice and neat all the time without pizza sauce stains or cookie/cake chocolate marks appearing on them when pulling the pans out of the oven , every time you wash these particular silicone pot holders they will eventually become more thin . in a few years they will probably tear or develop holes , increasing the risk of losing what little protection they had in the first place . it 's happened with several pot holders before , just like these ones . i 'm inclined to think it 's likely to happen again.so to be totally honest , i recommend searching for thicker pot holders because these ones are clearly below average . however if you 're willing to buy two sets you can adjust to these , but truthfully this is counter protective and you know as well as i do that you should n't have to make such a silly adjustment . companies should simply make thicker pot holders since they 're called `` pot holders '' .
= tricky pot holders
< a serious problem

> this is gregory funaro 's second thriller . the first was the sculptor . this is a prequel to that story because the events here precede the prior book , but it stands alone . both books are superb , engrossing , well-written . funaro will undoubtedly be recognized soon as one of the best mystery writers . both volumes contain unusual events with interesting complexities and twists . he pays careful attention to details , he gives his readers artful descriptions , he portrays his characters so that we like his heroes and are interested in his villain . he advances his tale in a reasonable and suspenseful manner showing how the fbi discovers the criminal . he keeps the inpaler 's secret , the reason for his bizarre behavior , until the appropriate time to reveal it , but he drops hints in a tantalizing way.fbi agent sam markham , whose wife was killed by a serial killer , is especially sensitive to serial crimes , is dedicated , observant , and smart . he is assigned as lead investigator to seize the impaler . readers will be fascinated to learn about this strange man and the pathology that made him act . why does he do what he does and in this horrible way ? what prompts his choice of victims ? why does he impale them ? is there a strange sexual significance to the impaling ? is there a connection between him and dracula ? is there a relationship between his acts and astrology ? what is the meaning of the messages that he writes on his victims ? why does he write ? why does he clean his victims ? does he clean his victims just as religious people in many religions clean the dead before burial ? is he performing a religious act with his murders ?
= another suspenseful thriller by an upcoming star
< a great prequel to the sculptor 's second thriller

> the beatles ' second film is great fun in a much different way than a hard day 's night was . a hard day 's night was like a day in the life of the beatles , which looked like it had a lot of inspiration from the classic era of silent comedies . director richard lester this time gives us a great spy spoof at the beginning of the james bond-spy phenomenon that was just starting to take off at that time . we went from black & amp ; white to vibrant color in just one year . i think this is what is really interesting if you see the two films together . both films are like night and day . essentially we still have two films about the beatles and the comic episodes they get in and out of but they are both filmed entirely different from each other . a hard day 's night is dryer and a more sophisticated looking film , which contains so many indelible images . the fun film help ! is a wild and insane comedy-adventure with its own brand of sophistication and is truly a product of its time . these two films were released just one year apart yet they look years apart . these films are great masterpieces and are a record of just how fast life and styles changed in the decade of the 60s . i really like this film . help ! has that great macroscopic globe trotting feel and look to it . help ! still gives the viewer that feeling of movement that was so prevalent back then . things were on the move and really happening . they were just great times .
= what a difference a year makes
< a great spy spoof

> the good : hands down the best option for the anti cable crowd . i had a netflix loaded blu-ray player before the roku , and the addition of amazon prime to my viewing ensemble prompted me to look at other solutions to bring my various channels . the roku fit the bill and i could n't be happier . the interface is fantastic and my universal remote navigates through it with ease . the channel listings are great and every month grows . the addition of youtube was a huge win for roku . i rarely have a disconnect and i love the automatic updating feature . pandora , netflix , amazon prime , youtube etc . everything i want in one package.the bad : i feel as though , while adding quality channels such as pbs , youtube , hulu etc , they have hundreds of useless clutter channels . i equate it to the apple store vs the android store a years ago . the apple store was clean and organized with generally only quality apps , while the open market android store had everything possible and you had to be careful . this is small stuff in the big picture , but just be aware that you will have to pick and choose your channels with care to avoid cluttering up your channels list .

> this is a very nice product but does n't actually meet your expectations depending on the situation . in my case i have a 27 & # 34 ; monitor with a couch about 10 ' away . the idea was to sit on the couch and use the wireless keyboard ... well though i have 20/20 vision , the distance is uncomfortable on the eyes for any regular typing as with an email or word document , etc . however for watching videos and typing titles on youtube , it works great . i imagine someone with a big screen tv might have better success in this area than i , but it also feels awkard to sit so far away from your computer screen after being accustomed to sitting right in front of it . as a result i sit in front of my computer to use it except when watching a movie . also , as others have noted , the keyboard is not as easy to type on as with a regular keyboard . be aware of this when you make the purchase .
= wireless keyboard
< nice product but not great

> this is a well written book with an easy plot to follow . an isolated couple keeps a child that they believe is abandoned , and when they find out otherwise they have to struggle with the consequences of their actions . unfortunately for me , the plot was a little too easy to predict . it took me until the second section ( the book is in three sections ) to become engrossed with the characters . the first section takes some time to set up the characters for the reader , a litle too dragged out for my personal taste . the author tries to provide one or two twists during the story but as mentioned , i found the plot easy to follow and not very exciting or eventful ( ie not full of surprises or unexpected behaviors by the characters ) . if you are looking for a book that is an easy read , written well , and contains an easy to follow storyline , than this book is for you .
= easy plot to figure out
< well written , easy read

> i am not usually much of a mystery fan , but the girl with the dragon tattoo grabbed me about 1/3 of the way in and after that i simply had to force myself to put it down to go to sleep . it is a fantastic book that really heats up about a third of the way in and never lets up . simply amazing , and now i am 100 pages into the second in the series.i was mystified by the ( few ) poor reviews of the girl with the dragon tattoo , until i read through them . in most of them the reviewers gave their ratings after quitting about 1/3 of the way in , just before the story jumps into overdrive ! do not be put off - this is a great book . when you finish it you will want to dive into the second one immediately . highly recommended .

> it 's a very watchable anime : it has a plot , a romantic interest , lotsa running around and shooting , and saving the human species . you know , the usual . we got geek stereotypes , smiling villain stereotypes , latent nobility stereotypes , good female lead with great hips stereotype , and everything else needed for a cool flick.the animation style is self-consciously computer-y for the bad guys . they 're very polygonal , as if they were n't worth a few splines . the good guys all look like cel animation , like those great 1930s movies from disney . and there 's everything in between . i mean this in the best way - all that computer animation is good , and the cel-like animation is good . connected ? well , not a lot.good space opera cartoons . no adult themes , no bloody violence . set your expectations accordingly.//wiredweird

> once upon a time , young manager paul smith worked diligently to prepare a slide presentation for the ceo of procter & gamble , a. g. lafley . to smith 's dismay , lafley sat with his back to the screen and did n't glance at the slides , choosing instead to focus solely on smith . this taught smith a valuable lesson : a fact-based pitch never works as well as a story . in this helpful manual , smith offers more than 100 stories readers can use in a variety of business situations . he teaches the basics of storytelling , including examples and exercises . smith 's easy and absorbing manner draws you into each tale . getabstract recommends that managers , salespeople and presenters read this charming compilation , from its useful instructions all the way to its happily ever after .

> i loved this book . it was sweet and innocent and exotic and romantic.this book focuses around a retired man who decides to start up a matchmaking agency . it takes place in india and explores the different way of creating marriages that traditionally happens in india . mr. and mrs. ali help their customers to find happy matches and gives them advice on how to handle their matches and why it is important to compromise.the descriptions of india , the culture and the food were very vivid and entrenches the reader in indian society . although i would have appreciated footnotes as explanations of such things such as the cast system in india the book was easy to read and hard to put down.there is nothing remotely racy in this book which makes it appropriate for readers that prefer their novels clean .
= a different type of romance

> quick-paced locked-room murder mystery starring william powell as the suave detective philo vance in what is easily the best entry in the series . a man is found murdered in his locked bedroom ( stabbed first then shot ) and powell goes through a large number of suspects before he ( and his dog - suspects are all members of a long island kennel club ) tracks down the killer . powell is perfect as vance , and the action unfolds with lightning speed , thanks to michael curtiz 's solid direction : he pans from one scene to the next in a flash ; the camerawork is also excellent for 1933. mary astor adds charm , though the picture could use more umph in the love- interest department . classy and interesting whodunit .

> pluses : very effective , straightforward to use coolerallowed no-issue overclock of my 2500k to 4ghz with no issues ( there are lots of other components such as memory and motherboard , but the coolermaster did its job ) negatives : requires backplate installation . this is n't a big deal if you 're building a new machine , but if you 're upgrading be aware that you need to have physical access to the bottom of the motherboardother : the fan disconnects really easily . this sounds obvious , but disconnect the fan from the heat sink while you install the heatsink to make it easier , then clip the fan back on when the heat sink is installed .

> paracord is sort of the duct tape for outdoorsmen ( and women ) . the original paracord was used for parachute shroud lines in wwii ; today 's paracord is a general purpose 550lb test line used for everything from tying up rucksacks to repairing the hubble space telescope ( yes , it really happened ! ) i 've used it for rigging tents and camping flys , tying gear to a roof rack , repairing a backpack that fell apart on a camping trip , and a lot more . it is , or should be , in every soldier and backpackers ' kit . but not all & # 34 ; paracord & # 34 ; is real mil-c-5040h standard paracord.a lot of the stuff you find on the web and in & # 34 ; surplus & # 34 ; stores is cheaply made , with thin internal fibers . it 's lumpy , the cover untwists , and it wo n't carry a load anywhere near 550lbs . the real stuff is of true kernamantle construction , with a braided cover , and an internal core made up of 7-9 inner yarns , each made from 3 twisted strands . if it does n't meet that description , it ai n't real paracord . and this is the real deal . ( the supplier is a registered military supplier , but i cut off a section just to check for myself . ) you can buy stuff labeled & # 34 ; paracord & # 34 ; for half the price , but really , why bother when the real stuff can be had for less than twenty bucks ?

> everyone knows the story of rapunzel and how she came under the care of a witch and locked in a tower . or do they ? rapunzel is here to set the story straight . yes , her father stole from a local sorceress while his wife craved an herb from the sorceresses garden . when her mother can not love her properly , the sorceress takes charge of the infant rapunzel.this rapunzel is different from those we may be familiar with . for one , she is born hairless . this is why her mother can not love her . but the sorceress does love rapunzel . the sorceress has even been looking for a girl like rapunzel for some time . she raises her as her own and teaches her how to be good . but she keeps rapunzel 's head covered to protect her from those who can not handle someone different . as rapunzel grows she learns more about what the sorceress does and what she expects of rapunzel . when illness strikes the local town , they are forced to flee . they wind up at a wizard 's tower . a magic tower that imprisons a girl with very long hair ... it is hard to talk about this book without giving huge amounts away . let me just say that the treatment is very fresh with some interesting twists . all of the right elements are there even if they are not connected in the same way as in traditional tellings of the story . a fast and fun read that is sure to entertain .

> gone girl by gillian flynn was a thought-provoking , dual perspective , mystery with a twist . numerous reviewers have discussed the plot of the novel , so i will give my overall thoughts.gone girl definitely held my interest . from chapter to chapter , especially in the beginning , i kept switching my opinion as to which character was to be believed and trusted . i liked that my opinion kept changing . a story has not done that for me in a very long time.the alternating chapters offered insight based on that character 's assessment and the reader had to decide what was real and what was bias.the book was an easy , enjoyable read . in parts , reality must be suspended as to the great lengths gone to in order to ensure retribution for acts deemed unacceptable . i willingly did just that in order to escape inside this story.on the other hand , i wanted to like both of the main characters more , and at the risk of spoiling the ending , i will only say that i wish that there was a better resolution . the author has left the door open for a sequel , but i always prefer to have an unequivocal ending . the evil character deserves punishment and the `` good '' or `` innocent '' should be redeemed . i was disappointed that it was n't the case with this novel . however , the book is one that i will remember and highly recommend .

> kate snow is at the end of her rope when she decides to swim out to sea and never come back . her swim is interrupted by famous pop star , charlie storm when she literally bumps into him in the ocean . what results from the unlikely meeting is the chance to put old demons to rest and a real chance to find happiness.strangers by barbara elsborg was an extremely emotional story for me because of the subject content . surviving suicide is a topic that is very dear to my heart . i identified with kate in so many ways and i entirely blame ms. elsborg for making me cry . i loved the chemistry between charlie and kate , the playful nature of their relationship made me laugh along with the story . there was a section that was particularly hard for me to read , and some would even debate on the consent of the act but i understood the necessity to include it and how it revealed the truth behind kate 's past . ms. elsborg built a story with complicated characters that had sexual chemistry , humor , quirks and somehow complimented each other perfectly . i thoroughly enjoyed the layers that made the plot interesting and the twists that kept it flowing . strangers will remain a book that i read over and over.giannareviewed for joyfully reviewed

> i pretty much knew what to expect going into away from her . a man has to make the tough choice to take his wife to a retirement home that helps those experiencing alzheimer 's disease.what happens at the place is the focus of the storyline . his wife becomes close friends with another man at the retirement home , but the great thing about the husband is that he 's honest , loving and caring which means he visits his wife all the time regardless of the fact she seems to have fallen for another man.the storyline development moves along at an extremely slow pace , but of course , it 's only appropriate to move along the pace as such a slow speed given what the story is about.the movie does n't focus on alzheimer 's as much as one would expect . the film is more about the story that develops dealing with the mans wife and her new male friend taking care of each other , and how the man has to deal with his wife in the condition that she 's in.i liked the movie . it could n't have been any better if you ask me . it told a nice story , was a little bit sad , will probably make you think , and it 's a movie worth watching

> compared to the bigger and heavier square-shaped beanbag gilsson mount i used to have , this is an easier fit in my glove box , and it does keep the gps unit in place.but because it 's smaller and lighter and the sides fold ( a bit ) , i often find that when i poke the gps 's screen , that just causes the gps to tilt back a little , and my touch does n't register.this seems to happen more when i touch things near the top of the screen , so i work around it by grabbing the top rear of the gps with my index and middle fingers , and poking the screen with my thumb . it 's not hard to do , but it would be better if i did n't need to do it at all.one trick i 've used to help reduce this problem is to sit the mount so that from the driver 's point of view its base is oriented as an `` x '' instead of a `` + '' - it helps , but it 's not perfect.basically , i liked the bigger gilsson mount better , except that it 's bulkier.p.s . if you want to check out the gilsson , search amazon for `` gilsson ubm '' .

> rise of atlantis is simply a wonderful game . it is a game in the genre of bejeweled but i believe it is more fun to play . you have to travel through the lands of greece , troy , phoenicia , babylon , egypt , carthage and rome and each country has 11 levels in it to play . needless to say each level and country gets harder to beat . your get a history lesson on each country as you tour and it is actually very interesting information.while playing the 77 levels you gather up tools that each have a unique power to help you finish each level . a little clue is not to use them unless you have to as your will need them a lot in the last few levels . the levels really get tougher and tougher to beat ! this game is challenging and entertaining and i believe you will enjoy it . playrix makes many games and they are all a lot of fun but this is one of the best ones out there . this game is like a good book , you ca n't put it down till you have finished it.i recommend it to you and i believe you will enjoy it .

> william shirer was a witness to one of the most incredible political events in the history of the world . a former vagabond , who never rose above the rank of corporal in the great war , adolph hitler managed to achieve absolute power in germany . using a program based on the systematic destruction of others , he came very close to controlling all of europe and northern africa . shirer was a journalist rather than a historian , so his writing is more in the style of a reporter than that of an academic . therefore , his accounts are more in the style of a witness rather than an explainer.this book is very well written and an excellent introduction for young people to the events leading to the second world war . i consider it the best popular description of the circumstances of hitler 's rise to power and how he managed to win so many nearly bloodless victories before the war . quite properly , the first two-thirds of the book deals with events before the start of the war in september 1939. it is one of the best books in the scholastic book series for young people .

> let me start this off by saying i am a person who needs this case . i drop everything . water finds my phone . i lose things only to have them fall off my car roof ... .so now that i have provided sufficient embarassment for myself , i will say that this phone is for people like me or for people who need this protection for their line of work or play.otherwise , go with the commuter or a cheaper case . you will find yourself complaining about the bulkiness otherwise.it has gone through being set in water ( on accident ) , dropped very high and onto hard places ( again , total accident ) , and being sat on and stepped on ( seriously , i 'm just accident prone ) .my only two criticisms are that the bottom flap that is released for the charger is terribly hard to get back to the locked position and it flaps around and that the top hole where the headphone jack is placed is not in the right place , you have to lift the whole entire flap for plugging it in rather than go through the hole .

> jen is a favourite instructor of mine . her routines are fun and energetic and this is the same . it 's an intermediate workout with basic choreography and lowish impact . it does get your heart rate up a bit and you do sweat a little , but it is n't quite challenging enough for me.it 's a combination of classic aerobics and fun latin moves . you learn a basic aerobic move , and then she adds the latin flare to it . i personally have only done this twice but never felt sore or tired as a result of it . i 'd use this on a day where i ca n't be bothered doing much else but still want to do something . it 's certainly going to burn off some calories , but advanced exercisers wo n't be overly impressed with this . jennifer is motivating and personable like usual , but i hope her next workout will be a little harder and more challenging .

> this book is thrilling and iteresting , sometimes very bothering . lisbeth salander seems a little to comfortable in her own skin for someone who has an abusive past and abusive present - but is a very interesting character . mikael is a little too swave and too much of a ladies man . how can you fall for someone who is very nice and caring but does n't realy get invilved or risk any emorional attachment . this is even clearer with the non-existant realtionship with his daughter.it 's a little greusome but tiltilating and a cliff hanger - although i found the end a bit dissapinting .

> chris cleave , incendiary ( knopf , 2005 ) dear osama , with these two words , chris cleave kicks off his powerful novel incendiary , and you know it 's not going to be something you 've seen before . and indeed it is not . the entire thing is written by the unnamed protagonist in a letter to osama bin-laden after al-qaeda bombed a stadium during a big match , taking the lives of her husband and son . she tries to make a go of life afterwards , but while she never explicitly asks the question , it 's embedded in every word : how does one regain one 's own sanity when the entire world has gone crazy ? the first , and perhaps biggest , thing to note here is that , as it 's written as a letter , the entire book is in the voice of the protagonist , who is not terribly well-educated and eschews the use of commas . twenty-five pages into this book , i was sure i was going to offer it up as a sacrifice to the gods of reading by lighting it on fire and tossing it into a random trash can , but i got used to the narrative style pretty quickly after that . once you 've fallen into the rhythm of the prose , the story itself is gripping -- our narrator is trying to get on with her life , just as england is , and the two are often compared to one another between the lines as a measuring stick , making sure we 've got the idea in the back of our heads that the end of the book is a given .

> in the roman empire in the second century a.d. , hadrian 's wall , in northern britain , marked the official roman `` end of the known world '' between roman-occupied britain and the untamed territory north . the protagonist in this story , marcus , is the son of a roman officer who lost an entire legion of 5,000 soldiers when it forayed north into this uncharted territory . worse for roman military honor , the legion 's standard ( its `` eagle '' ) was lost as well . his family name had been tainted by the loss , and he of course seeks to reclaim the eagle , find out what happened to the lost legion , thereby restoring his family honor . towards this end he asks to be posted at the northernmost roman garrison in britain , which is considered to be a backwater posting that no one would want.no spoilers here , but basically marcus journeys north of hadrian 's wall in search of the standard , accompanied by his british-born slave . more would be telling.the most impressive aspect of this movie is its moody cinematography . one truly gets the atmosphere of a british landscape ( scotland , actually ) pristine and almost untouched by man , and completely untouched by civilization . never have i seen a film that conveyed this impression more powerfully.the story here is straightforward , and not especially complicated . nor is the acting anything terribly impressive . the story moves along at a brisk pace and holds the viewer 's interest , but the real power of this film is the cinematography , not the storyline or acting . for lovers of roman military sagas , this is a good one . recommended . rjb .

> when jackson curtis ( john cusack ) set out on a camping trip with his kids , little did he know that the world as he knew it was about to end . it seems top scientists and world leaders have known for years what the mayans knew - that the earth would be destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis in 2012 - and only a few people would be saved aboard giant arks being built in china . jackson , being a resourceful ( and preternaturally lucky ) guy , rushes his family to china with no time to spare.this movie delivers on the special effects , no doubt about it . watching california collapse into the ocean was really convincing . there were two problems for me , however : i did n't like any of the characters ( many of whom were cartoonish ) and the endless narrow escapes were too ludicrous to take seriously . cusack was n't a strong enough leading man to hold my interest ; likewise amanda peet never convinced me she was a real wife and mother experiencing the last day on earth . their kids were too cute , the russian bad guy was neither villainous nor funny , just off-putting , and danny glover was wasted playing a noble president.i 've enjoyed watching emmerich 's other disaster flick , the day after tomorrowmany times because the characters were sympathetic , the plot was compelling , and the effects did n't dominate the story . this movie had too much cgi , unbelieable action , and an ending that was never in question . this is a good enough movie to see once , but that 's all .

> i 'm a bit confused about this book . i 'm not sure who the audience is . it certainly is n't historians or scholars of the supreme court ( i am a lawyer and study judicial politics , so i count myself in this audience ) . the book is much too superficial for that . that 's a shame because in public o'connor is often outspoken and one hopes she has recorded her honest thoughts for posterity.i guess maybe o'connor is hoping to reach the general public with stories about the supreme court . i have no clue if there 's really a market for that . given the number of negative reviews on amazon , i suspect most people bought this book looking for a more intellectual analysis . however , frankly , o'connor probably revealed far more during her book tour , when she all but stated that she regretted the court 's decision in bush v. gore.so , in short i 'm not sure how to rate this book . i know it 's not for me . maybe if you 're not well versed in supreme court history this might be a fun introduction , but just do n't take this book too seriously .

> `` salmon fishing in the yemen '' is the kind of absurdist comedy that the british do so well informed by american style romance movies . i have virtually no interest in salmon fishing and even less for rom-coms . the fact that the film kept me engaged means it 's a smashing success . the romantic chemistry between ewen mcgregor as a stuffy fish and game official and emily blunt as a perky attache to the sheikh of yemen is palpable . kristen scott-thomas chews the scenery with aplomb as an aide to the prime minister . the film is virtually stolen by amr waked as the sheikh of yemen whose dream of bringing salmon fishing to his arid homeland is n't so much a personal pecadilloe but symbolic way to unify people of all backgrounds . not classic stuff but a great thinking man 's non-think diversion .

> there is not that much to say about these bands , except that they are exactly as advertised by the manufacturer . the reviews complaining that they are too short , too long , or that they do n't like the material may have valid points for their applications , but if you are looking for 4 foot flat latex bands in three different levels of resistance , than look no further . these bands are exactly as advertised.i agree with other reviewers that longer bands are better for some applications , but my point is that you should n't complain about a 4 foot band being 4 foot , if that is what it was advertised as being.these bands are what they say they are . if that is what you need , i recommend them . if you need something longer , they also sell longer ones .

> since getting my kindle two and a half years ago , my reading has picked up dramatically , finishing more than 140 books in that time . this book and `` stone 's fall '' rank in the top five of this list . at $ 1.99 for the kindle edition , i bought it without bothering to download a sample . the first few pages dragged a little but once the story moved to england in the 1930 's , it became `` un-put-down-able . '' i read all of it this past weekend and was disappointed when it ended . check out my other reviews ... nothing compares to this book and it 's one of those rare books that i may end up reading again .
= without hesitation , this is one of the best books i 've read ever
< this book is a must read

> salad spinners have now been with us for 30 or more years , and if you 're going to buy one , the oxo , like almost all oxo kitchen tools , is among the best . but for the cost of an oxo i can buy a crate of kitchen towels , and it does n't take any more time to lay lettuce on a towel than it does to get out the spinner , rinse it , spin the lettuce , dry the spinner and put it away . buy a dozen towels and just toss each one in the laundry after use .
= great at what it does ... but ... .
< great for the price

> the best tampons are the ones you do n't have to worry about . this one certainly fits the bill . individually wrapped , they are easy to transport and the wrapping withstands the jostles and jeopardy from transport in a cluttered purse , bag or backpack . the plastic applicator makes insertion easy . the fit is fine and they provide excellent protection without compromising comfort . they are unscented which is a definite plus . these are a great option , delivering ease of use , comfort and absorbency . recommended .
= comfortable protection
< great protection

> we have several of these sticker makers . this is the one we use the most useful , most used in our home.it is very easy to refill , very easy to create stickers , and very fun . we have made name tags , stickers for scrapbooks , stickers out of photos to put on art projects and send to grandma , and so on . it is endless the possibilities once you start making stickers . we have completely enjoyed this little machine .
= super easy , lots of fun
< great for the price

> this works very well . i love all the options for intensity . you can do it very gently for kids or very intense if needed . the water capacity is perfect , it will be all you need to floss . like the way the cord coils up inside of it . it is easy to tip over when plugged in but we have very limited counter space so thats part of it . its great , works well .
= works great
< great product

> i bought this to replace a cover that i had a mere 6 months that was falling apart.this one is impressive looking . it goes in with ease , but snug . the only thing i do n't like about it ( after a few months of use ) is that the stand is a bit difficult to put on , and it sits a little wonky . but definitely not a deal breaker for me .
= better than many other options out there
< great cover

> the pilot was okay , but i was really rolling my eyes at the second episode . the overall problem is the tone of the whole thing . it 's kind of slick and cheesy . characters do n't feel that dangerous . barbie just is n't very cool . i 'm slightly piqued by the changes from the book but i 'm not going to stick around .
= the look and feel of a cheesy network tv show .
< i was really rolling my eyes at the second episode

> i would really like to give my kindle 5 stars , but it lacks a good way of organizing music and pictures . i experience no other problems and enjoy it every day . i have a 7 & # 34 ; hd kindle fire and this 8.9 hdx out performs in all areas except music and pictures which is the same as my old kindle .
= excellent
< great for the kindle fire

> i love this game and was excited when i saw it today . but its laggy and a bit hard to control . hopefully this can be fixed with aand update . i love this game so please fix the lag . now all we need is dragon vale and high school hero ! !

< love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

> the bottom line : though the advent of digital photography may render the theme somewhat obsolete , this well-directed and acted horror film acts on the audience 's fears convincingly for a majority of the film until the not-entirely successful ending .

> after my gps stopped working , i started to depend on my iphone for driving directions . at this point , there is no reason not to use your smartphone for everyday commuting gps ... sorry tomtom : - ) anyway , this mount is very easy to mount on any material 'd dashboard ( if you 're baller and have a leather dashboard or some other high quality material..maybe think twice about using this since it 's suction cup can leave a ring-like mark after being removed ) . the suction cup works very well , once you suction it down it will not come off until you want it to.the holder itself is on a ball joint , which lets you position and tilt your phone as you desire , the arm itself is adjustable too so you can change height . the knobs to let you loosen and tighten are big and easy to use too . very versatile.my favorite thing about this iottie is how easy and fast it is to pop in your phone and take it out . basically you just push the back of your phone into the holder , the two pinchers on the sides snap tight on each side and hold your phone in place very firmly . the bottom suport and pinchers have enough leeway to allow your phone to stay in it 's case ( even a big mophie juicepack case ! ) too . when you want it out , just pinch the release nubs and the pincher arms open up.my phone has not fallen out of this thing once , it has n't even jostled around - this thing 's got kung fu grip ! for almost any sized smart phone , this does the job very well . buy it !
= fantastic car mount , not just for iphone for any phone .
< great for the price !

> 1st generation kindle eink reader from 2007 was given to me a year ago , i just decided to upgrade it before giving to my gk 's , customer service said a 4gb card is required . then another user in the kindle forum discussions chimed in and said he uses a 32 gb sdhc card and it works fine . well , long story short , it does work , in fact it works awesome . i spent many days purchasing ebooks , free and paid , and audible.com audiobooks for the free classic books for only 99 cents ! ! books for my grandkids . also i transferred mp3 music , about 13 gb of classic classical music on it as you can listen to music while reading ebooks either with or without headphones . some gregorian chant-pop music ( yep , there is such a thing ! ! ) and i figure there is still enough room to put another 300 books/audio books . as an off comment , i am surprised at the quality of sound the kindle 1st gen has . with headphones it comes in kind of close in quality to an ipod.awesome 32 gb sdhc ! ! class 4.i 've been using this card for 3 days nonstop , programming the kindle to give to my gk 's . so far , it has not failed me . i have always purchased sandisk 's and i always will . you can not argue against quality and performance and durability . a few years ago it was a 50.00 flash memory card . today , less than 20 ... got ta love technology and consumerism .

> a strange young man is orphaned after a car accident which 'kills ' his robotic parents . adopted by a kindly nurse , he is enrolled in high school ( he was previously home-schooled ) where he is bullied and an acquaintance commits suicide . at high school he is befriended by a girl named amandla , and has strange encounters with homicidal robots and a purple-wearing super hero called the mink.i was prepared to really enjoy omega the unknown . i collected comics for many years , and really enjoy the medium . but frankly it was just a bit too weird for me . i also found the art rather primitive and ugly , especially the way the character 's faces were drawn . they look preternaturally old , particularly the children . there is an 'acid trip ' quality to the storyline with things going on that make no sense , and characters acting inexplicably . for instance , i really did n't understand who the quiet omega man was , why he was mute , what was going on with him , or why i frankly should care . the mink was an oddity , a sort of commercial hero ala booster gold , and what was with the robots ? the ending was strange and rather depressing.meh . this just did n't appeal to me . when i read comics involving superheroes i guess i 'm just more traditional . better art , and a more coherant storyline would 've made this book more appealing to me .
= weird
< not free sf reader

> outstanding book ! what a concept , this world of sameness . no hills , no sunshine , no rain , no snow.. no love , or other emotions we experience on a daily basis . a woman and man are paired together , they get each one boy and one girl.. job assignments.. another big one is no color..what happens if you should get `` released '' ? lots of questions will be answered in this book.when you are a `` twelve '' you get your job assignments . jonas is so excited , but at the ceremony he is passed over . at first he is embarrassed but then he gets the greatest honor of all . to be a `` receiver '' . jonas has no clue what that is about , but what it is is , the `` receiver '' gets all the memories , good and bad and keeps them so that if the community has a question , they can go to the receiver and see if their idea is a good or bad one , because they know everything about why they made the rules the way they are , because of pain , hurt etc.i hope i can explain it half as good as the book does . loved this story . i wo n't say any more , but if you have n't read this book yet , order it right now ! you wo n't want to put it down ! i recommend this book to everyone !
= outstanding , a book for everyone !

> most of us know from watching zombie movies that you have to get away from zombies at all costs . this normally includes having to fight some of them - easier said than done . the crazies is different in some important ways than other zombie films . in this movie , the zombies do n't look or move like typical zombies.in the crazies , a potent virus has infected a small town through the water supply . it makes people violent and spaced-out , just like normal zombies , but it does n't change their appearance that much . this virus does n't result in bloody-looking faces , for example . and it does n't prevent its victims from thinking through violent plans.zombies that think and carry out plans did n't feel as scary to me as other zombies because they did n't seem like monsters . my impression was that crazies-type zombies each have their unique identity somewhat intact . this makes them far less predictable but at least you do n't have to imagine people you know becoming quite as soulless as traditional zombies . either way , you can never have too much ammunition.in sum , i do n't think the crazies was as scary as movie as 28 weeks later or dawn of the dead . it 's difficult to improve upon the scariness of traditional zombie situations . yet the crazies was very professionally done . in my opinion , the movie was not worth watching .
= fun yet not frightening to me

> when a hollywood soap opera producer is murdered , the suspects are numerous . wollie shelly 's best friend , joey , is painted by the media as the most likely killer . several personal crises in joey 's life add to that image , not to mention a painting worth $ 1 million that she inherited from the dead man.wollie 's new job as a dating consultant on a program called soapdirt makes it easy for her to snoop around the set . her assignment is to date soap stars and dish about them on television , complicating her blossoming romance with fbi agent simon alexander.though third in this series , this book stands well on its own . there are mentions of events and people from previous books but they are not too revealing and provide just enough information to keep up . my advice is to start with the first one and enjoy all of them . each one is better than the last.i love kozak 's take on hollywood . as an actor in movies and on soaps , she has an insider 's view of that lifestyle . her characters and dialog ring true . i also find her laugh-out-loud funny . be careful where you read her books . people are bound to interrupt you to find out what you are laughing about.armchair interviews says : a book that will tickle your funny bone and your mystery-loving gene .
= funny stuff , well written
< a book that will tickle your funny bone and your mystery-loving gene

> did you ever pick up a book based on the title and the little publisher 's blurb thinking it would be a great book ? i found nothing but disappointment.naming of the dead is actually a continuation in a series of stories by ian rankin , and this one picks up with the assumption everyone has read the previous books . unfortunately , i had not . there was very little to help me figure out the characters in way of personality . the other part of the book that disappointed was the fact that the story was very passive -- the author did a lot of telling and very little showing . for this to be a mystery or thriller or suspense , you need action and that is what moves the story along.i ca n't even really tell you what the story is about since it did n't hold my attention very long . i 'd rather read a thousand page manuscript that is full of action and keeps me turning the pages than a four hundred and fifty something page story that is telling me everything.i 'm sure to others that mr. rankin is a great writer and probably has some good books out there , but he 's not for me.armchair interviews says : possible problem for any reader who has not read others in series .
= more from ian rankin

> secret agent james word ( i guess his word is his bond ) has just returned from a mission . he is met by his superior 's assistant ( his superior is uu ( double-u like an upside down m ) ) . she plays coy and sexy but really just wants the details of his mission . during breaks in apparent intimacy he recounts his tale.he has been investigating a major bourdin who has been have a series of run ins with a mysterious force of women . they are led by zeta and have the ability to teleport . it is unknown if they are from space , the future or another dimension , but they have set up a colony of women . they add to the colony through kidnaping and brainwashing.the film appears to have made no attempt at being erotic ( check out the strip poker scene as an example ) and the plotting is wooden ( although some of the actual acting is quite good ) .in the end we learn what the secretary is really up to and the final fate of james . i have to say that i enjoyed it more than i thought i would based on the other reviews .
= better than expected
< a good read

> i really did n't hear any buzz about this one and i wish i had . i rented and will probably buy it . it is one of the best historical dramas that i have seen . beautifully filmed with great acting and costumes . many movies have shown bits and pieces of elizabeth before with betty davis being one of the best , but this rivals even her magnificent classic version . i highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance . the movie centers on protestant elizabeth dealing with the catholic king philip ii of spain . his inquisition is sweeping europe and threatens the freedoms of all , including the english . spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned mary queen of scots . some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the english channel with the spanish armada make it a feast for the eyes . the acting is quite good though so we never feel as though this is just eye candy . fans of the movies `` apocalypto '' and `` elizabeth '' should see it . excellent dvd with good replaybility .
= elizabeth 's golden age
< one of the best historical dramas ever !

> however ... that was a bullsh*t move by the author adding to more books to the series . i was about 25 pages to the end , and like most , wondering how she going to tie everything up in 25 pages ? ? ? and then it ended much like the sopranos fade to black series finale and i thought wtf ! her message to the readers about the story continuing was like a slap in the face . but just judging this book on the `` quality '' of the story , i would give it a 3. there were storylines introduced that i thought distracted rather than enhanced the main story . her mom and dad , terri and the model , the receptionist , brent , corinne ... too much ! i know you ca n't right about the 2 of them in bed all the time ( although she tried ) , but give them something else to do but whine . i gave it the 3rd star for the hot plane scene ... but the book was really a 2 star at best .
= not on the hate bandwagon
< i was expecting a bullsh*t move by the series

> i really expected to like this book . perhaps it was the chihuahua ( i have two . ) i really thought the beginning was a lot of fun with the dog inadvertently calling the daughter in law , but for me , this book just got to silly . the sexual references in this book just were n't funny and the fact that the author spent most of one chapter and part of another discussing whether or not her character should go hairless ( to the south ) or not kind of made me lose interest and wish i was watching the paint dry somewhere else.i found some of the dialogue to be pretty good , but the speech of the aunt was horrendous . she did n't sound like a new yorker she sounded like a hick with a mouth full of cotton candy . there were some fun things about this book , such as the silly haunting , but overall i just thought it could have been a lot better . really great cover though .
= started out promising .
< not a good book

> i sifted through many of the case reviews - all of which seemed to blend ipad 2 with ipad 3 in an attempt to take advantage of the fact that the 3 was almost the same size as the 2 , and also gloss over the fact that the magnetic sensors moved.in short - this case works very well with the ipad 3. it fits great ( slightly snug , which is an indication that this case might have actually been made for the 2 ) , but i like the snugness . it is a solid fit . most importantly to me is that the auto-off feature does work with the ipad 3.the chosen `` upright '' angle is good . i will likely not have use of the hand strap as , for my use , it is placed slightly too far underneath the ipad . i would wish it nearer to the left side of the ipad , since my left hand would be using it .
= works great with ipad 3
< great case for the ipad 3

> phillip seymour hoffman , christopher walken , and catherine keener star as members of a famous string quartet that is celebrating its 25th year . one of the members is suddenly diagnosed with a catastrophic disease , but this is just the first of many revelations that rock the group and threaten its existence.before i saw this movie , i was indifferent to chamber music ; now i can say that i truly dislike it . well , i dislike the movie , anyway . the characters were all self-absorbed , obsessed , and unlikable prigs who acted as though the world revolved around them . hoffman , in particular , fairly wallowed in his self-importance . their problems were life-changing for them , but i did n't care.classical music lovers will enjoy the music and musicians will be able to relate to the quartet 's all-consuming passion for their work , but i found it dull .
= for classical music fans only

> 'pinkalicious ' is the most appropriate book for my three year old granddaughter who loves the color pink . this book is written by victoria and elizabeth kahn and illustrated by victoria kahn . it is a beautiful book and for little girls who are in the princess stage , the perfect book.a little girl and her mom on a rainy day made cupcakes , pink cupcakes . the little girl ate so many cupcakes she turned pink . this is her story . no one wants to be bright pink , and this little girl truly learned her lesson . the story is delightful and funny . i can see the smiles and giggles on my little granddaughter 's face . this is so much fun ! beautifully illustrated and almost all pink in color , 'pinkalicious ' is the kind of book that most little girls and boys willenjoy.recommended . prisrob 03-06-13

> i love this series but da'av is particular love of mine , and i found this book engrossing , moving and did n't want it to end ( especially in the way it did ! ) i do n't think this works as a standalone , i think you need to read scout 's progress and even local custom before you come to this book . as it is , i read it in the order it was written and had read all the adventures of da'av and aelliana 's children , and then to return to them , knowing what happens from the outset , is bittersweet indeed.i confess that i will read anything set in the liaden universe , but even i like some books/stories better than others . this one definitely stacks up for me . i rate it a keeper and will reread . enjoy : )

> a few years ago i tried mcafee as my laptop security system for the sole laptop that i was using then . since then i have switched over to norton internet security and have found the latter much better protection in dealing with viruses and other forms of malware . mcafee total protection 2012 provides most of the same services that norton internet security provides ( anti-virus , anti-spyware , anti-spam ) , but does not have its own two-way firewall to defend users from hacking . at the very least , mcafee total protection 2012 offers much of the same protection as norton internet security , but does so at a lower price . if price is your primary consideration , then this is the laptop security you need ; otherwise , i would recommend instead , norton internet security .

> why are my patients dying is a short story well written that will intrigued you start to finish . wilpenter writes with the smooth confidence of a likeable dr. tess , stumped by a slew of sudden deaths in seemingly healthy people . the author did her homework and puts all the right medical terms in the right places and leaves you guessing every time you want to know more ! this book is short and sweet and moves along nicely , easy to read in one sitting . i like the fact the story ends suggesting jayson and dr. tess may hit it off ! looking forward to the next chapter . bravo !

> i 'm not much of a fan of axe products ; whether it be body spray , body wash , etc . axe 's detailer shower tool looks kind of cool to the naked eye , but at the end of the day , it really is n't anything special in the least , or really any different when compared to any other loofah or body wash tool . that being said , it does what it is intended to do , which is scrub and wash your body , so in those respects if that is what you 're looking for , then that 's what you get here .
= nothing special
< does what it is supposed to do

> this movie always seemed rushed to tell the story and you never really feel connected to characters due to their stunted development . i think if this movie was split into two parts to tell the story more fully it would have gotten a higher rating from me . brad pitt is great on screen but he just seemed hollow ; again due to lack of depth of his character . most of the others in the movie were forgotten the minute they left the scene . i would not buy this film with it is worth a spin if you do n't have anything else to do .

> my friends and co-workers encouraged me to watch this show , and i honestly thought they were crazy . finally , i watched one episode - yes , one episode - and i got hooked . it 's not all about the zombies . there is a lot more depth to this show than a bunch of zombies . it teaches one that material things are not everything and it demonstrates the strength that humans possess when trying to survive against horrific odds ( although the apocalypse is unrealistic of course ) . it is just a show , but a good one !
= best show on tv !
< a good show

> this movie started off well , and then we are introduced to the twist that some people have been replaced by robots . i started to fear that oh no , this movie is going to get stupid ! but it actually worked out better than i would have expected , with an ending that is quite funny . it has some of the same actors as in shaun of the dead and et.al , and also some of the same film style/work as these other movies . overall a good movie if you 're a fan of the actors .

> this exciting book tells the story of ronald reagan & # 8217 ; s lifelong war against communism . skipping unnecessary background history , the book immediately launches into the exhilarating story of reagan & # 8217 ; s defiance of communism in hollywood , and his presidency of the screen actors guild . following that , the book follows the history of american-soviet relations under the various american presidents . and then , in exquisite detail , the author follows the actions of president reagan , as he wrestled the soviet system into discredit and bankruptcy.let me start out by saying that if you want a balanced look at president reagan & # 8217 ; s strengths and weaknesses in dealing with the soviet union , then you will be *terribly* disappointed by this book . this book is a shout of & # 8220 ; halleluiah ! & # 8221 ; , a celebration of reagan & # 8217 ; s courage and farsightedness . using newly opened soviet sources , the author looks at what the americans did throughout the era , and what the soviets thought and did.i must say that i enjoyed this book immensely . coming of age at the beginning of the reagan revolution , i remember a good deal of what this book covers , but this book does an excellent job of filling in the details that were unavailable at the time ( secret meetings between americans and soviets , politburo discussions , personal opinions from both sides of the wall ) . therefore , if you want an exciting , fact filled look at ronald reagan & # 8217 ; s triumph over communism , then i highly recommend that you get this book !

> we 've been using this unit for a couple of weeks now and have no major complaints.we quickly learned that setting the unit on any by its four `` spray controls '' beyond low is an invitation to having a lake form on your floor in front of the unit . you odefinitely do n't want the spray shooting out over a carpet : it will eventually get soaked , i think.the only other negative so far is the somewhat musty odor encountered when opening the door to the closed room this unit has been running in with the heater on . it smells like the odor is being leached from the plastic water tank . it has become less pronounced as the unit has been used more.beyond that , so far , everything is fine . the unit is virtually silent . controls are easily set , including turning off the nightlight and visual pyrotechnic display on the front panel.the detachable water tank is easy enough to fill in a kitchen sink , though i suspect it wo n't work well with many bathroom sinks . another reviewer asked why manufacturers ca n't just have these tanks fill from the top . i have the same question.the unit disassembles easily to allow access to the `` ultrasonic disk '' for cleaning.so far no white film on anything . we run the unit overnight in a 12 x 20 or so bedroom and , as noted , it is on the lowest setting . no complaints about the results.the unit appears to be and feels well constructed.overall , compared to our old unit with its need for filter changing and constant scrubbing , this one is a gem.jerry

> i 'm something of a reluctant fan of the dresden files series . the whole premise behind the series seems a bit silly , and the quality of the books has been somewhat uneven . still , there 's something about wizard harry and his misfit companions ( why does that sound familiar ? ) that is downright irresistible.in blood rites , harry is still in the midst of his one-wizard war with the red court of vampires ( though the book focuses only on the black and white courts ) . the plot of the book is split between harry 's discovery and planned annihilation of a black court nest and harry 's sole vampire ally thomas raith enlisting harry 's help to protect a friend 's adult film studio from magical harm . the latter plotline finds harry dangerously entangled in a white court power struggle . the black court storyline is handled well and probably should have been the subject of an entire novel . it had a vampire $ feel to it , which is a big plus in my book . the white court storyline was compelling for a different reason . the adult film/evil eye part of it was , to be blunt , stupid , but the detailed look into the politics , powers , and players of the white court was quite interesting.as interesting as each vampire court storyline was , they both took a back seat to the revelations blood rites contained regarding harry 's background and lineage . this is just the kind of character development the series needed , and will make for some very interesting reading ahead .

> this is a pretty funny book , full of great characters . first is the super smart ten year old , chiyo-chan . then there is osaka a slightly weird girl from osaka . then there is tomo-chan , the very loud girl who wants to beat chiyo at , well , anything , and sakaki , the cool , well developed , girl who happens to like animals . there 's also yomi , the smart girl with glasses , and kaorin , who has dreams about chiyo 's ponytails and seems to have a crush on sakaki . then there are the teachers , none of which are normal . with over 160 pages you get a lot of stuff . there are two four-panel scenes on each page and , whether they are part of a story or a stand alone scene , they are funny without getting heavy or too emotional . they 're cute . the cats seem to have issues , but most of the book is very cute.the book 's cover says it 's for 13 and up , which is true . at one point the girls are talking about their bodies , so it is really for young adults . the cover also says it is an `` action/comedy '' manga but as there is very little in the way of car chases and gun battles i would ignore the `` action '' and just take it as a `` comedy '' .

> during his presidency , thomas jefferson was researching an explosive secret on the location of king soloman 's mines . hidden in a code for personal correspondence with meriwether lewis , the documents ultimately become a key in the early years of the 21st century to unlocking a door which has explosive ramifications on world history.with war , murder , theft and the peeling back of layers of dead leads dating back to at least 900 b.c. , co-authors clive cussler and paul kemprecos sail on a journey to solve the mystery surrounding an ancient artifact - the navigator - and the story it can tell on the mastery of the oceans by the phoenicians.with good and evil on a collision course on land , sea and in the air , it is up to kurt austin and the numa team to fight for truth and justice . and there are plenty within the shadows who will stop at nothing to acquire the navigator ; leading the way on this sordid list is a billionaire philanthropist - and his coterie of hired guns - whose smile is oftentimes the kiss of death.a solid action thriller with quality character development , the 532 pages capture the search for forgotten footprints left by explorers , no matter what the odds .

> this was a real eye-opener for me when i first bought it as an lp back in the mid-60s . i was used to the styles of such modern hard boppers as art blakey and horace silver , and this was basically nothing like that . the most `` radical '' piece is the omen , which is totally free and contains some of the most spirited and adventurous jazz of the 60s . hutcherson 's marimba solo is absolutely compelling , and joe chambers 's multi-percussion voices are fascinating , culminating in an explosive ending . herbie hancock 's maiden voyage gets an excellent reading : there are lots of spaces in the theme that allow a great deal of tension to build . head start is the most traditional tune , taken way up tempo , and is reminiscent of speak low . rojo is a latin piece with an excellent hancock solo and a powerful bob cranshaw bass solo . this has to rank as one of blue notes most ambitious albums of the mid-60s , and one of hutcherson 's best . nice !

> pride & prejudice is a handsomely mounted production , moodily filmed with a pervasive dark texture of visual expression about it . it is quite a visual presentation of the story where dialogue is left unspoken and the power of the images both animate and inanimate speak for themselves . that is not to say that the film goes on without dialogue , but rather quite the opposite . the many exchanges of dialogue are witty , brilliantly structured , eloquently spoken and presented with an economy of style that is concisely intelligent . this film with its intricately mounted visuals and words does an admirable job of bringing this literary work to the screen with all the constraints inherent in the medium of the cinema . director joe wright also did a more than commendable job of representing the two main characters . keira knightley gives an awe-inspiring performance as lizzie giving her great insight of the human condition . lizzie though impetuous at times has a gift of rationalizing human behavior with a certain sense of reality offsetting loftier romantic ideals thus making her a young woman of keen intelligence . i truly enjoyed matthew macfadyen 's performance as darcy . he seems a young man tired and perplexed by convention but knows no other way to conduct himself and is trapped by his by his social status but more importantly by his own upbringing . matthew macfadyen 's does an exceptional job conveying this . awkwardly trying to emote his inner feelings he does more to alienate lizzie than win her affections . macfadyen 's darcy is truly a man misunderstood . only through good and anonymous deeds can the true nature of the man prevail . i think this is a very good film rich with artistic fervor yet embracing all that is good of the human spirit . the dvd extras are very good .
= concise and exquisitely beautiful production and dvd

> i 've been looking for the perfect earphones since i bought my first ipod in 2004 , so when i was offered the chance to try plantronics ' new backbeat 216 earphones i jumped at the chance . they 're designed with the iphone in mind , so there 's a slim microphone/volume control located a few inches down the wire on the right side.as far as sound goes , these noise-isolating ( not noise-cancelling , but close ) earphones are pretty impressive . i think thelogitech ultimate ears 600vi noise-isolating headset - dark silverseries has better overall sound , but this set is n't bad at all . it 's definitely a step up from the standard apple earbuds.as for functionality , i found this to be very useful when using the phone . the clarity both on the receiving end and ( i 'm told ) using the mic was quite good . the volume control is also handy when listening to music while the phone is in a pocket or otherwise out of reach . for me though , the ultimate test is how well the earphones hold up at the gym , and i 'm happy to report they worked very well . they stayed in place the whole time , and kept out a lot of the noise of the surrounding fitness machines so i could focus on the music.the plantronics backbeat 216 earphones are exactly what i was hoping for . i do n't know that they 're going to satisfy audiophile-types , but for everyday/exercise use , they 're a fantastic addition to the ipod/iphone , and are priced reasonably as well .

> rhett miller 's solo debut is a fine example of melody and smart lyrics combined into an admirable listening experience . lines like , `` my friend is trapped in a shame spiral '' and `` every one of us has a secret rhythm beating like a drum , '' create a feeling intelligence while each song has a musical setting that provides the listener with pleasure . name dropping kafka and dellio make sure you 're paying attention and songs like `` the el '' that approximate train sounds reminiscent of `` the orange blossom special '' just end up putting a smile on your face . nor does miller forget the emotional components of songs ; many here deal with relationships at all stages sung like a man who has an understanding of what can go right or wrong with them . this is just a well balanced effort from an artist who has decided to follow his own muse . occasionally not everything works on the same level , `` four eyed girl '' is just a throwaway and `` i want to live '' is far too strident , but these are the exceptions . it is a song like `` your nervous heart , '' with the singer 's tentative approach to a loved one 's anger at the day 's end that make this one a keeper with my hope that miller will provide more of the same in the future.ps . the believer is even better !

> yes , orphan train reads like a ya novel , and should be sold as such . it has all the elements -- young protagonists , heavy plotting with an excess of coincidences ; thin and facile characterizations ; minimal historical context . i suppose if i had n't known about the history , the novel would have held some interest on that basis , but i was aware of the orphan train phenomenon and therefore found little of interest in the book . i think it would be fairly successful as a way to spoon feed some history to a student , so i gave it two stars on that basis . for an adult , it 's a one-star experience , basically junk reading . i 'm not surprised it was only issued in paperback . the publishers knew what they had . it 's a bit scary to learn that the author has taught creative writing .

> `` two for the road '' is a film that i admire but i ca n't say i like particularly . it 's certainly well crafted and the scenes of the french countryside are gorgeous . the chemistry between albert finney and a luminous audrey hepburn is palpable . what was a little offputting to me was the structure of the film where they crosscut moments from the marriage of finney and hepburn in non-linear fashion . the makers of the film may have thought this clever but i found it headache inducing . also a little offputting was the constant bickering between the two . for sure there was some profound insights about the disintegration of this relationship but the verbal sparring became numbing after a while .

> a cavity in a tooth is a bad result , usually , from something good . in the case of this book , however , i view the ending as the `` good '' result while the rest is less enjoyable . despite even this , the end is n't that great.i suppose i 'm growing tired of the narrative tricks some male british writers continue to trot out each year . mcewan 's novel follows julian barnes ' `` sense of an ending , '' which itself followed `` atonement '' from several years before . beyond experimentation with the narrative voice , there is n't much here other than a sentimental retrospective -- cloaked in espionage -- of how life evolved at a pivotal moment for one woman and those around her.it is a nice story , but the book feels like a waste of mcewan 's talents . he writes such crisp sentences and develops characters in such a tight ( yet fulfilling ) way that it is a shame that this particular story gets bogged down in places and becomes a writer 's workshop of short stories mixed throughout . i found myself reading the snippets of short stories and thinking , `` he is showing off . '' ( yes , i guess that becomes part of the point as the novel moves towards the conclusion ) . i found that the stories did n't add much or further compliment serena 's world , or the world of those around her . they only served to further muddle the plot and what made her who she became.if you 're into trickery , then the ending may be enough for you . if you 're into a fuller story that shows broader character evolution or fully fleshes out themes of relationships , gender , and love , then perhaps look elsewhere .

> ginnifer goodwin is one of the more likable young actresses in movies and tv today , yet whenever she gets a chance to headline a film , it 's in a predictable romantic comedy like something borrowed . she plays rachael a lawyer who is struggling to find happiness and meaning in her life as she enters her 30 's . kate hudson who has n't made a good film since almost famous plays darcy , rachael 's lifelong best friend who is engaged to her law school friend dex played by colin egglesfield . john krasinski plays ethan , rachael & darcy 's childhood friend . the film focuses on rachael & dex finally realizing they were meant for each , having an affair and ending up together in the end . ms. hudson is absolutely dreadful as darcy . the character is supposed to be extremely self-centered , but she plays her so over the top that you ca n't understand why her rachael have remained friends their whole lives . mr. egglesfield is pretty wooden as dex . he is supposed to be the smart , sensitive type . based on what his character is supposed to be , you again ca n't understand why he would ever want to marry darcy or be best friends with a shallow womanizer marcus ( steve howey ) who uses a variation on an injured chipmunk story to bed women . the scenes between mr. krasinski and ms. goodwin are the only reasons to watch this film . they work great together and add a touch of heart to the film . i 'd love to see them act together again because they had some really good chemistry .

> i have been increasing my reading on china and this is the first book that covers its auto industry in such detail . china 's demand for autos is increasing fast and its own brand , chery , is turning into a profitable endeavor.author greg anderson 's writing style is straight forward . the book is not filled with business jargon , nor is this a boring read . he makes the chapters interesting for most anyone , and they do n't have to be business majors , business leaders or sinophiles.anderson notes that the fast-paced chinese auto industry is flourishing in a country with little personal freedoms , heavy government funding and chinese communist leaders who all have a stake in this . this odd combination of ideologies in the booming chinese business world could very well be the recipe of success and cooperation for american businesses dealing with china in other productions . anderson notes that this unique blend of communism and capitalism is becoming the new chinese labor mission , as the chinese have surpassed the koreans and japanese in growth.anderson is , according to his bio , a `` specialist in finance and chinese political economy who has been either living in or frequently traveling to china for nearly two decades . '' he knows the country and the chinese well . his phd in political science at ucla focused on industrial planning , business-government relations , and corporate governance . his background gives this book an authoritative voice .

> as much love as some of their other albums get , be they genre-defining or just consistently amazing , this might be my personal favorite . and i own them all . `` kiss me kiss me kiss me '' is n't just their longest disc ( actually a double lp ) , it 's also their most diverse . upbeat pop and moody goth are all present here . to start , `` the kiss '' is one of the absolute best non-hit songs they 've ever done , and i never tire of it . three of their biggest 80 's songs are also included , `` why ca n't i be you ? `` , `` hot hot hot '' , and of course `` just like heaven '' . however , tracks like `` torture '' , `` how beautiful you are '' , and `` one more time '' i love just as much . `` the perfect girl '' and `` a thousand hours '' are well worth mention also . in fact , the only negative thing i can say about this disc , is that the song `` hey you '' was omitted for time reasons . it is on the double-record and cassette though . although i 'm sure others have said it before , between the music and even the cover art , i find this album to be `` just like heaven '' .

> phillip roth has done it again - written a book that grabs an audience for multiple reasons , not the least of which is his frank sexual experiences dating back to portnoy 's complaint , then manages to use his magnetic wrtier 's tools to explore some of life 's more major questions . this short novel is a an interior conversation of a man growing old but still depending on the only badge of youth he has ever known - sexual performance . yes , his affairs with his students are less than appropriate . yes , he seems to make secondary any other encounter that might result in unveiling the presence of a scholarly mind . but at the same time , roth 's main character grows closer to the inevitability of death as merely a part of the life cycle in his central alliance with a cuban born beauty . not to destroy the twist that occurs in his obsession with corporal things , roth finally makes this affair conclude with discovery that is sensitive and heartfelt . & quot ; the passage of time . we 're in the swim , sinking in time , until we finally drown and go. & quot ; this book is filled with rich word pictures , philosophical flights of thought , and just plain fine writing . worth reading on many levels .

> this is lionel 's 8th solo studio cd and it 's been a little while for his fans , but now finally we have some great new music to hear . the first release , i call it love , is a really nice ballad ( with his extra skinny daughter and csi miami 's adam rodriguez in the video ) . it 's a good start to the cd . the rest of the cd is really nice music , but not the fantastic music of his past where he would have strings of hits . it 's a lot of adult contemporary music but still should have his fans enjoying it . jermaine dupri produced what you are and that happens to be my favourite song here . i also really like reason to believe and all around the world ( a more upbeat brazillian style song ) .this did n't grab me on my first listen through , but after a couple of goes , i 'm really enjoying the cd and glad that lionel is back again . i am a big fan of his and do enjoy this and hopefully his other fans will too and will even score some new fans .

> this is a decent tool to determine if there is a moth problem in your clothes closets . it traps the male adult moths but , as clearly noted in the product description and on the box , the male adult moths are not the ones that chew through your clothes - that 's done by the larvae . so this wo n't solve a moth infestation problem , but rather will let you know if you have one.if you can see moths flitting about in your closet , or have noticed chewed wool items , this is not worth getting - you already know you have moths ! this is for alerting you to a problem before it becomes severe , so you can take action to get rid of the larvae before they do too much damage . methods to get rid of the larvae include washing , freezing the clothes for a week , steam cleaning , and/or chemicals.if you 're looking for an alert to a potential problem , this is a decent product to have . if you already have the problem , this wo n't solve it .

> overall this was an ok curry . on the plus side , it 's very easy to make - basically cook the beef , then add in the curry mix ( 2 pouches ) , simmer and serve . i added in some vegetables and served it over jasmine rice.my complaints are that it had more of a sweet taste than i was expecting or cared for . it 's a bit oily as well , and could also use a somewhat greater kick with regard to spices . it also had larger pieces of leaves that were not all that appealing.although i made this with beef , i think it would be as good , and perhaps better , with lamb or pork . the sauce alone is workable over rice and veggies should you prefer not to eat meat.it made for an interesting dish that everyone ate , but i probably would not get this again . i prefer the taste of indian curries ( ideally from scratch , but in a pinch the taste of india pouches are pretty good ) .

> the basic idea of the book is a good gimmick for making a political and cultural argument.goldberg does have interesting things to say about why and how an extremely left- wing media- mad culture is ' doing - in ' america morally.as someone who tends to be on the same side of the political spectrum as he is i should then be celebrating this work.but i am not and for two reasons . one is many of those on the list are people who so to me of very very small weight and importance.secondly , the list focusing so much on hollywood people and media stars of various kinds ignores the great number of very important people who are in my judgment anyway , doing damage to america.the list has very few major thinkers and intellectuals on it . it has very few major political leaders . it focuses on people who will be forgotten about before they even have a chance to be remembered , minor players in trivial areas of life.this is an interesting idea but it is very imperfectly realized .

> having not seen 'goodfellas ' to compare this to ( at the point when i watched this film ) i was thoroughly impressed with 'casino ' . a great deal of it is shot with de niro doing a voice-over , telling the story as he went , which i really liked . the way a casino was run and how it all relates back to mob control was fascinating to see and the various tricks the customers and casino owners use are pretty inventive . some parts of this film are pretty graphic , as to be expected from scorcese , but the story overall is gripping and kept me engaged the whole time . the extras disc is excellent , with some great featurettes and bonus material to really add to your understanding of the film . this is a great gangster type movie and brilliantly directed and acted . well worth a viewing.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> i read this to my 7 year old who thought it was good enough to share with his 5 year old friend who thought it was hilarious . i 'd say he showed the most enthusiasm . my 4 year old wanted to keep the book , because she thought i was giving it to her brother.i do n't get the book ( it 's basically the view of the rear ends of the animals as they stack themselves up a tree ) but the kids seem to like it . definitely not one of those kids books adults can share and enjoy . just a kids book for kids who are obsessed with the rear end . like mine , whose favorite song for a long time was `` i 've got a butt .

> with sarah michelle gellar 's growing disatisfaction over her role , it came as no surprise that she did n't extend her contract ; thus making season seven of buffy the vampire slayer the final season . beginning with a poor season primere written by series creator joss whedon , buffy and her crew are thrown into conflict with an entity called the first ( you 'll remember it from the season three episode opposing angel ) who is gathering a massive army to destroy the world . in the meantime , new characters are introduced including principal wood ( d.b . woodside ) , a new villain named caleb ( firefly 's nathan fillion ) , andrew ( tom lenk ) becomes an unlikely ally , and rogue slayer faith ( eliza dushku ) returns for the final battle . for the most part however , season seven is erratic at best . an early episode examining anya 's ( emma caulfield ) past is excellent , and `` conversations with dead people '' is great as well , but such storyline elements as willow 's ( alyson hannigan ) redemption and spike ( james marsters ) gaining a soul appear to build up steam but go nowhere fast . the final episode `` chosen '' is a solid piece of television on it 's own , but even hardcore fans will find some kind of disappointment out of it as buffy and crew fight the final battle to close the hellmouth . season seven is undoubtadly the worst season of buffy , and as a fan it 's just sad that the show went out with a whimper instead of the proverbial bang .

> after reading several scathing reviews of the film and negative commentary from fellow moviegoers like myself , i decided to throw caution to the wind and check out the movie myself.well , my verdict is in : the movie has its high points ( peta wilson as mina harker , a jaw-dropping turn-of-the-century super automobile , and an interesting turn on the captain nemo character plus the crew of the nautilus ) .however , the overabundance of computer graphics and the rather poor dialogue ca n't make this adventure anymore than average . the fight scenes are too many and the stunt doubles can be too easily spotted for connery and naseerudin shah ( `` nemo '' ) .the final battle between mr. hyde and a similar incarnation is almost laughable . computer-generated special effects were better handled in the two `` lord of the rings '' films.if a possible franchise was in the minds of the filmmakers , then they blew it . big budgeted `` fireworks '' are n't enough to entice filmgoers for a return visit.think `` lost of space '' of several years ago ! had the moviemakers stayed closer to the spirit and wit of the graphic novel , then this picture would 've been more enjoyable.in the words of marlon brando from `` on the waterfront '' , it `` coulda been a contender '' in the summer blockbuster sweepstakes .

> the revolutionary war is ripe for a bit of revisionist satire ; there is an inherent pomposity to be found in any number of the `` founding fathers '' that would be fine material for a more sophisticated examination . last refuge for scoundrels , unfortunately , lacks the sophistication to make his book anything other than a mildly annoying work of fiction . using an exceptionally broad brush , lussier gives us the revolution and its main participants as mere puppets of deborah , a prostitute who is fighting for the common man . deborah 's mission , aided by john lawrence , a love struck boy who grows , remarkably , into a love struck man , is to manipulate the war and its participants into creating a country that will provide a better life for all . from boston to the court of versailles , one by one , the important events of the war are on display , seen through the eyes of of our protagonists with nary a laugh to be found . i had high hopes for this one and perhaps the review is a little harsh because an excellent opportunity seems to have been wasted . lussier is not without ideas , but the tale of deborah and john that this story hangs on is one that left me cold .

> this was one of the most overly melodramatic novels i have ever read . it was very difficult for me to keep a straight face while reading it . the conversations and inner-dialoguing was a little too much in parts of this book.the story/plot could have been an interesting one had i been able to like either one of the main characters , but i was not able to . through the majority of the book , they are just too manipulative and selfish . the erotic scenes are for the most partunsatisfying and leave you , as well as isabella , wanting more . however , true to formula they are working up to something more later on.for the life of me , i could not figure out what the author meant when she described isabella 's womanly parts as having `` flanges '' -i looked it up and i was flummoxed.all in all i could not get into this book , these characters , the curse - i do n't know why since so many others seem to have really liked it .

> this is the story of the rescue of one- thousand jewish refugees from the death they would have suffered at the hands of the nazis . it is written by an american- born woman ruth gruber who was appointed by the secretary of the interior harold ickes to accompany the refugees and help them wherever possible . gruber who already was a known writer and photojournalist proved to be a lion- hearted defender of the refugees . in part it was her work which made it possible for them to stay in the united states and resettle there after the war.gruber shows great courage and determination , and human sympathy in her relation to the refugees . she interviews and speaks with them and tells their often heartbreaking stories.behind the difficulty of their entering the u.s. and being allowed to stay is another story . that of the hundreds of thousands of jews who might have lived had the doors been open .

> melvin was a momma 's boy with a promising basketball career . despite the special treatment he received , he tried to do the typical teenage activities . after being blamed for a major loss , things began spiraling downward . what becomes of this young man who 's trying to prove everyone wrong ? cole riley penned a story that we see a lot in the african american culture . society puts these young athletes on a pedestal that is easily snatched from under them with a lie . sometimes , that lie can do great damage and some individuals do n't always rebound . the characters are so realistic . you get a feel for them all and can feel the emotion . i highly recommend & # 8220 ; little white lies , & # 8221 ; especially those who see sports as a ticket out.reviewed by : jas

> marriage gets the kubrick treatment with a study of a couple who are committed but still curious about others . tom cruise wanders through a dreamlike state after his wife tells him of a sexual fantasy she has had about another man . during the christmas season , he wanders from a christmas party through to a bizarre sexual orgy where it seems his life is threatened and girl who protected him is murdered . but is the incident real or a dream ? the movie really never clears up the confusion and we are left trying to understand what exactly happened which is not like the tom cruise and nicole kidman characters themselves . a wonderful dreamlike film .

> ` cambridge ' tells the tale of a girl whose days were all bad . she does n't seem to like her mother and the feeling appears mutual . she does n't like school or her sister . she is an intelligent and judgmental little girl . she admits she wants to feel disconnected and she is ... wherever her family lives , in england , in boston , in greece.in the end , she decides her childhood is good , but we are left with a bad one since we 've already read what existed . what the significance and the purpose are - is undecided , seemingly for the author and the reader too .

> i think this book was meant to really tear the reader 's heart out however , it comes across as an uninspired soap opera , melodramatic beyond reasonable limits . one is overly aware of the author controlling the story rather than the characters being allowed to develop it.i have n't read anything else by this author and i 'm assuming that she meant well by this book . i sense a possible involvement and maybe the problem is that she 's too close to a similar situation to be able to write objectively . i wish her good luck with her next effort .

> a 6-year old child prodigy is viewed as humanity 's last , best hope against an alien menace ... but can he be honed into an unbeatable military genius before it 's too late ? yep , that 's pretty much the story , with some sub-plots tossed in that feel like filler ( though this is book 1 in a series , and they may well come into relevance later on . ) per the author 's introduction , this started life as a short story and was subsequently fleshed out to novel length . it certainly feels that way.on the bright side , this is a quick read and does n't require too much brain power on the part of the reader . the library i got this from shelved it in `` young adult '' which i feel is appropriate.unfortunately , this was one of osc 's first novels , and it certainly feels like an early work by a starting author . bare-bones descriptions , stilted dialogue that seems unbelievable from the lips of someone still in single-digit age , and a painfully predictable plot . science fiction is notorious for requiring `` suspension of disbelief '' -- which i normally have no problem with . the suspension required here , though , was n't anything technical ( super-fast space travel , etc ) but the aforementioned social aspects.i 'm not sure why this won the awards it did . i recognize that there 's something of a cult following to this book , and again i 'm not sure why . i did n't hate it , but i did n't go `` wow ! '' either . i can only assume that the street-level buzz around it built it up too much for me . i probably would have liked it ( more ) if i 'd read this 30 years ago , but now i only felt let-down . i have no interest in reading the rest of the series .
= okay if you ignore the hype ; otherwise , very overrated .
< not a bad story , but a little predictable

> disclaimer : i primarily purchase my harissa as a paste and prefer this brand : harissa paste . however , having this on hand is a convenient way to 'roll your own ' on short notice . a key advantage to the dry spices is you can make a paste as strong or mild as you like . the disadvantage is getting the proportions right . for that reason i will always prefer the paste that i purchase , but will always keep some of this on hand too.like all zamouri spices and blends that i have tried in the past , the spices in this one are fresh and aromatic . sometimes the brand takes liberties with ingredients in some of their mixes , but in the case of this harissa i think the mix and proportions are nicely balanced.if you followed zamouri 's recommendation of mixing equal proportions of this mix , olive oil and water you will be rewarded with a decent harissa paste that has both flavor and a bite . in this particular mix cayenne pepper and paprika dominate the flavor , with easy to identify garlic and salt . there are other peppers in the mix that add piquant nuances , as well as hints of spices that impart interesting flavors.while this is a north african/mediterranean spice , it easily complements any cuisine , and especially mexican and caribbean . of course , it is perfect for any middle eastern dish that calls for flavorful spiciness . that means it is perfect with palestinian and some turkish dishes . in fact , do not be limited by my narrow recommendations - if you live a little heat in your food let your imagination run wild with this .

> oasis hit the music scene in 1994 with the incredible debut album & quot ; definitely maybe & quot ; . only 8 years later , the forthcoming album & quot ; heathen chemistry & quot ; is , if i can keep track , touted as their second & quot ; come-back & quot ; album , after 2000 's & quot ; standing on the shoulder of giants & quot ; , viewed by many as a failure but in my book an album with some of their greatest tunes ( & quot ; who feels love & quot ; , & quot ; gas panic ! & quot ; ) but i digress ... this is the first single of the forth-coming album . & quot ; the hindu times & quot ; is a hard rocking song , reminiscent of the sound on the debut album , and where the title of the song comes from , i have no idea ( it is not part of the lyrics ) . but a great tune , for sure . the & quot ; b & quot ; sides are both noel-penned and sung tunes : & quot ; just getting older & quot ; finds noel worrying whether he 's & quot ; cracking up or just getting older & quot ; ( hint to noel : yes are are getting older ! ) , and & quot ; idler 's dream & quot ; , a beautiful piano-based ballad.i 'm looking forward to the new album , out in july , to see whether oasis is really , truly back in the saddle . stay tuned .

> i bought the kindle version of this . first of all , i need to mention that there are quite a few errors in the kindle edition . pages were n't lined up properly ( so when i went to the next page , 3-4 lines of text was repeated , and once some lines were missing ) . the errors were concentrated in the beginning of the book and did n't affect my comprehension , but it was still annoying.as to the book itself , it was a pageturner . i read it during one day of christmas break . i saw the surprise in book 2 coming , as well , but i enjoyed the plot devices and the twists and turns . the biggest problem is the last third of the book , as others have mentioned . ok , fine , it 's not believable , but i do n't really think that was the author 's point for the entire book . it 's a thriller , and i can accept it on its own terms . the last third , however , does not hold up even in the world of the novel . it ran out of steam and was disappointing . i still found the overall reading experience enjoyable , however . it provided entertainment .

> i wanted to like `` captain america '' but the movie 's faults made this a one-off -- good enough to watch once , but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years . the characters had potential but did not live up to this potential . steve rogers and peggy clark have a chaste little attraction going , but it never matures into anything of note in the film . steve rogers himself lacks depth , and the film could have developed him , and his friend `` bucky '' much more . the same is true of the villains -- they are one-dimensional bad guys and that is pretty much the end of it.the special effects are good , and i applaud that the movie is pretty much true to the original `` captain america '' story . i just think that this one could have been done better . rjb .

> i would n't read this before going to bed as you might end up dreaming about it or a similar situation happening to you - i did ! to me , that fact alone reinforces the opinion i had when i finished it last night this was a very good short story.considering the nature of a short story - not too much room to get things done - the author does a great job of quickly getting you up to speed and understanding the background and underlying situation . i could remember a few people growing up who fit both of the main character 's backgrounds of the loner nerd in the op pants as well as the popular girl.there is a pretty good kick with the ending that had me eagerly awaiting what would happen next . if you could n't tell , i really enjoyed this one and am looking forward to reading more from this author !

> frank oppenheimer is the younger , less-well-known brother of robert oppenheimer . the book is written by a family friend and is quite sympathetic to the oppenheimers who suffered significantly during the red scare . frank 's career in physics , studying the cosmic rays via stratospheric balloons , and his subsequent move into science education forms the skeleton of the book . his lasting contribution is the exploratorium , a revolutionary science museum with a strong hands-on focus which has influenced virtually all science museums worldwide.the book is a bit long in spot , especially during the colorado political exile years , but is well-written , entertaining and gives a good view of the life of an american scientist . recommended for the history of cosmic ray physics as well as the story of the building and running of the exploratorium .

> `` gim me shelter : ugly houses , cruddy neighborhoods , fast-talking brokers and toxic mortgages : my three years searching for the american dream '' ( 320 pages ) brings the tale of author mary beth williams and her husband looking to buy a place somewhere in nyc pretty much at the height of the housing bubble . when i saw the subtitle of the book , i just had to pick up.what i liked most about the book is how williams was able to suck me in with the ultimate storyline . you just know that they 'll end up buying some place , but the big question is where ? will the family remain in brooklyn ( where the husband really wants to remain ) , or will they look elsewhere , even ( gasp ! ) across the river in jersey ( where the author grew up ) . along the way the couple have a second daughter as well.props also to the author for sneaking in a `` toxic mortgage 101 '' lesson at various places in the book . observes williams : `` if the value of your house has been over-estimated ( a likely scenario when the housing market is euphoric ) , if you 're trying to sell and the market softens , if you lose your job and you ca n't keep up with those high interest payments , if any number of things that happen in the real world occur , you 're screwed . `` last but not least , you can just feel the exhaustion setting in as the couple goes to open house after open house , only to see their dreams dashed time and again . in all , the book is well-written , entertaining and it kept me in suspense until the very end as to where the couple would end up . a perfect book for the dogdays of summer .

> until writing `` unfit for command , '' corsi was a `` financial services marketing specialist , '' despite having a harvard phd in political science . now its `` the obama nation '' - a book built around making mountains out of molehills ( eg . quibbling over the number of times obama 's visited africa ) , guilt by association ( eg . communists , socialists , campus radicals , future swindlers ) , and demeaning obama 's father.actually , obama really does have a quite thin leadership resume , and his management experience is even less . corsi , however , chooses not to emphasize those or other more substantive points.however , it is ridiculous for corsi to assert that an obama presidency would leave the u.s. militarily weakened and an economically diminished nation - after bush ii did exactly that , and a similarly militarily impetuous and economically ignorant mccain ( `` bomb , bomb , bomb iran , '' strong support for georgia vs. russia ; make permanent the bush tax cuts and expand `` free trade '' ) would continue major bush policy mistakes .

> billy joel , still under contract with columbia records , immediately began work on this album following the release of piano man . this is joel 's third album overall , but the second columbia one . the only top 20 hit from this album is the entertainer , not to be confused with marvin hamlisch 's song of the same title from the 1973 paul newman-robert redford film the sting . every song was composed by joel . that song would later appear on the compact disc greatest hits vol . 1 & vol . 2 ( the lp and cassette does n't contain it ) . streetlife serenader and los angelenos would be recorded live in 1980 for 1981 's songs in the attic . this album features two instrumental tracks , root beer rag and the mexican connection . rbr would inspire the postally-requested billy joel newsletter . hey , since those songs have no lyrics , joel could have symphony orchestras record their own versions ( joel has been writing classical music since 1999 ) . the other songs are good .
= cool album !
< joel 's third album

> the most striking thing about `` colombiana '' is not the action but it 's intelligence . it contains a story that 's thought provoking and characters that are neither buffoons or cartoon figures . it 's heartening to know that the antagonists and the much maligned feds in action movies are not idiots . this ratchets up the tension of the narrative immeasurably . this film works on all cylinders . taut script , crisp editing , and gangbuster direction by olivier megaton ( `` taken '' ) . if zoe saldana is n't a household name after her tour-de-force work in this film there is no justice . she expertly juggles the physical and emotional demands the film calls for . behind the cool veneer of her hired assassin lies a vulnerable sensitivity . this not only makes her character more intriguing but makes her more desirable . produced by luc besson this stands with his previous masterwork `` leon-the professional '' . in a genre full of wannabes `` colombiana '' rises to the top .

> i thought this would be a fun idea to make a tiny winter garden indoors . we have a lovely warm sunny spot that is just perfect . so i got some nice planters and planted the seed pods . i read the directions and followed them carefully . i have actually gardened for years but this is the first time i have tried a ready made garden.only 1/2 of my pods sprouted and one of the sprouted guys looks like he is not long for the world . so there are huge gaps in my planter but these little seedlings are n't exactly hardy enough to move . it is a very fun idea and might be a good way to introduce gardening to kids or adults that do n't have room for a full garden . but i have had much better luck just dropping seeds in the ground and hoping the birds do n't eat them .

> saw iii is probably considered a bloody mess and this sequel does tend to drip on the sloppy side , but saw iii still pulls off another fascintating , twist ending . no big names in this one , just the return of jigsaw and his apprentice , amanda . some of the graphic and brutal tortue scenes are kind of silly but i always liked to story behind as to why these individulas do n't appreciate their lives ( jigsaw has an obsession of people who do n't feel grateful ) . this sequel does n't compare to the original or even saw ii , but if you want to know how this baby ends then indulge yourself in a little game of cat and mouse . enjoy !

> no matter what , grisham knows how to tell a story and keep you entertained . this is actually my least favorite of the five or so grisham novels i have read , but nonetheless it delivers . it 's a fast read , a page turner , and not at all predictable . he throws a huge plot curveball that i doubt many will see coming . some of the plot does stretch credulity but i did n't mind it all because it was so highly entertaining . another very good one from a gifted creative mind .

> an unforgettable slice of wartime life in england , mrs miniver stars greer garson in the role she was born to play , one which earned her an academy award in 1942. the story opens in the last peaceful summer of 1939. we meet the lovely kay miniver as she frets over buying a particularly expensive but beautiful hat . it is a lovely , carefree scene which sets up the idyllic existence of kay and her family in the close-knit village of belham , a world which literally disappears when world war ii breaks out . kay , her husband clem ( walter pidgeon ) , eldest son vin ( richard ney ) and his beautiful young bride carol ( teresa wright ) become the central characters in a saga which scales the highs and lows of life lived in the worst possible circumstances , but the miniver clan muddle through with strength , will and self-respect.there are many memorable scenes in the film : kay reading ` alice in wonderland ' to the two younger children whilst in the bomb shelter ; clem leaving for the shores of dunkirk on his rickety fishing boat ; kindly station master mr ballard ( henry travers ) growing a rose in honour of kay ; and the amazing sequence where kay herself confronts a downed nazi fighter-pilot in her kitchen.mrs miniver remains to this day a moving account of wartime life in england . it 's purpose during the war was to boost morale , and that it did . today , mrs miniver is still regarded with affection and love . may it always be .
= `` this is the people 's war , it is our war '' ...

> i 'm sure it 's in the fine print , but i had run-ins with gecc before and should have expected the worst . when i signed up for an amazon store card it was because i work in online teaching and needed a crash replacement for my computer -- it 's how i make my living . i signed up for the card , and bought the computer . i later also used the card for smaller purchases as christmas gifts . what i did not realize is that when i make payments , my payments are not credited to the interest free purchases , but used to pay off the miscellaneous smaller purchases first . in other words , the payments you make are applied to your balance in such a way that your interest free purchases are the last ones paid off -- a play by gecc to invoke the little fine print clause that says if you do n't pay the whole thing within the 12 months , you must pay interest for the entire purchase amount.this may not be illegal , but it sure is deceptive and unethical.i recommend anyone interested in the amazon store card to find any other way to finance your purchase unless you 're absolutely positive you can pay off within the required limit -- otherwise `` interest free '' is a meaningless slogan.i 'm shocked that amazon is working with this unscrupulous provider of banking services .
= beware -- your `` interest free '' balances are the last ones credited !

> all his life gene garrison has been controlled by his father , tom . when gene , a widower , wants to remarry and move from new york to california , his father wants him to remain to care for him . tom 's wife has also just died . that leaves him with only gene , since tom disowned his daughter for marrying a jew.i never sang for my father is really the story of a sensitive man trying to break away from a hardened one . the fascinating part of the film is the power tom has over gene : gene actually wrestles with leaving . he knows he is being controlled and manipulated , but he goes through every ambiguity to justify staying in the situation.gene takes the whole film to finally make his choice , and when he does , there is little resolution . the sad part of this movie is there probably no resolution for someone like gene -- he is to thoughtful and conflicted about who to make happy , himself or his father.gene is of course played by gene hackman , tom melvyn dougless , and estelle parsons is amazing as gene 's sister . the film was released in 1970.not enough people saw i never sang for my father . director billy friedkin did , and it took a screen test for hackman to show he could play a tough guy , detective popeye doyle .

> this is by far the best solution i 've found to deal with stinkbugs . the bugzooka is simple ( basically a bellows at one end that you compress and release with a trigger to suck in the bug ) and it works far better than the battery powered bug trappers i 've tried . very easy to use . just point it at the bug , press the trigger , and the bug gets sucked into the trap . no batteries , no chemicals , no fuss ! so far i 've not had any bug fatalities from their trip into the bugzooka . i 'm not all that concerned about the demise of a stinkbug or a moth , but i like that i can trap the beneficial bugs , such as ladybugs , unharmed and set them free in the garden.it comes with two trap ends ( one clear , the other dark ) and a hook to hang it on the wall . i did n't bother with mounting the hook since this gets used all over the house , but it 's a nice thing to have.i bought mine from the same seller , but through their ebay storefront . the price was the same as on amazon , but there was free shipping.the price is a bit steep for such a simple product , but it does do the trick . very pleased with it and highly recommend .

> i first read `` the shining '' in 1977 and i do n't know how many times i have read it since then . i consider it to be one of stephen king 's best books and just reread it again because i heard king is finally publishing a sequel to danny 's story calleddoctor sleepdue out in september 2013. i can hardly wait.this tale of the torrance family , especially danny with `` the shine , '' the overlook hotel , and halloran , the cook , is a masterpiece of horror . i consider `` the shining '' andittwo of the scariest books i 've ever read . i think this is because not only because of the supernatural horror aspects of both books but also the human elements that contribute to the horror.i also love both versions of the movie made about this book - the well-known movie with jack nicholson , scary but not following the book very well -the shining , and the mini-series that was faithful to the book -stephen king 's the shining ( two disc special edition ) .if you have never read this book and love horror , you owe it to yourself to read it . if you 've read it before , read it again to reacquaint yourself with the great story and characters before the sequel comes out .
= `` this inhuman place makes human monsters . ''
< a masterpiece of horror

> i had the original movies and later decided to chance the extended version for the scenes that were cut . normally , i avoid the deleted scenes simply because they tend to have a couple that are good and the rest you think `` good idea to cut '' after seeing the extended versions , i think the added film makes the film better.roughly there was the additions added 30 , 40 and 50 minutes to each film . some you do n't even notice and others greatly add to the characters.for example , i liked the interaction between eowyn and aragorn where she tries to figure out his age . the fall of saurman . though it was not not from the book but i still liked it.the extra disks are interesting as well . you get commentary from the actors , etc and you see what was involved to make the film . not something you watch all the time ( unless you are into this kind of stuff ) but it 's still interesting to see what goes on.so if you are debating getting this and a factor is the fact you own the theater release dvds . get this kit and give away the films . that 's what i did !

> when it has came down to invicta , they definitely have been the quality leader in making great watches over the years , not just in demand , but class and innovation . they have made some really great automatic watches for the past several years , but the demand of their great timepieces has definitely exploded over the past years . but for anyone that wants a over-sized timepiece without worry about the price , this is definitely one i recommend . this pro diver grand diver automatic is a great timepiece that is simple and easy to take care of . what i honestly love abut this piece is n't just the style , but the blue face and excellent illumination of the watch . what i do though wish was that this piece would be a bit easier to open and close with the safety lock . it can be uncomfortable , and the unidirectional bezel can stick a bit . but nevertheless , thi is a good watch to get for anyone that wants a bulky automatic , without the waste of price.price : bsetup & comfort : b-overall : b 1/2-

> i am not usually keen on real life dramas , but once in awhile one comes along that is so good i have to tell about it . probably not since one of william macy 's extrodinary jobs have i seen such an incredibly real role as ray , played by melissa leo . the rest the cast are excellent as well and you will feel you are living with them in their trailer in the frozen north with the mohawk reservation just down the highway . the story of a white woman and mohawk transporting illegal foreigners across a frozen river so they can make enough money to raise their families and buy a double wide trailer is compelling . the typical problems that families have are all here and how they impact their plans are all to real . excellent quality movie with plenty of replayability . if you enjoyed this catch `` the wool cap '' .ca luster

> i 'll admit i 'm not generally a healthy eater and do n't have too many organic fruit bars , so i 'm not sure what to compare this with . however , i thought it was pretty good . it 's a bit like a soft granola bar - you can taste the grains , without the crunch . however , for me at least , the cherry flavor was n't very strong . i love anything cherry ( i drink cherry-flavored seltzer regularly ) , and thought this bar had more of a strawberry-cashew flavor . still tasty nonetheless .

> there are some very detailed ( and great ) reviews here on amazon for fire tv . kudos to amazon for posting the good and the bad . my review here is quick and basic.for $ 100 , this becomes a letdown . i 've used google 's chromecast ; i have a roku 3 ( the best still ) and a so-called smart tv with apps as well as a tivo roamio ( newest version tivo with apps ) . the tivo and the roku 3 are great products but the roku 3 still prevails as a best choice . it has vudu and m-go but amazon 's fire tv does not . the roku 3 is plenty fast and it continues to deliver a solid product even after a years worth of technology advancements.fire tv delivers a great remote ! if i like talking to a remote ... beyond that , it delivers a unprepared allotment of apps and misses the mark at major apps as one would have hoped for.maybe it will get better but now , it 's just another toy with a cute remote . worth $ 49- $ 59 but certainly not $ 99.i 'm experiencing far too many programs that i attempt to play ( amazon instant/prime ) that claim to be included with prime membership ( and they are ) but they fail to play on the fire tv unit . there was a firmware upgrade but it did not help . when i attempt to play basics , i get a on-screen advisement saying it is n't available at that time.roku 3 is far more reliable and ready for performance .

> for a brief time , fans rejoiced when they first heard that the original star wars trilogy would finally be available on dvd without any added alterations . yes , finally we would have on dvd the movie trilogy that inspired generations , including the first film that had no episode number and han shooting first . but , as george lucas would have it , the original films are here , but they 're in non-anamorphic widescreen and dolby 2.0 ; something which you would expect films of this magnitude not to be , but then you must remember , this is george lucas , and this is star wars , and the man will milk it every which way he can . as a previous reviewer had already stated , with the trilogy already available on dvd and these upcoming releases due out soon , it wo n't be too long before another set is released containing all six films , with the original trilogy in anamorphic widescreen and dolby 5.1. you know it will happen , and you know that these editions are not worth picking up . if you already own the first release of the films on dvd , do n't be duped again , and if you do n't , do n't pick any of these films up . wait until they get re-re-released again ( it 'll happen , you know it ) , and maybe , just maybe , the original films that we grew up loving will finally make their way onto dvd the way they should be .

> so you think van hunt is another assembly line neo souler , riding on the coattails of marvin gaye , prince , and stevie wonder without bringing any identity to the table ? think again . like his colleagues before him , twentysomething van hunt 's self-titled debut is big time retro , dipping neck-deep into seventies r & amp ; b and funk , with some gorgeous ballads tossed in for good measure . but there 's a difference : van hunt 's witty lyrics , which rise above the predictable and paint colorful pictures of the ups and downs of love . there 's plenty of replay value on standouts like & quot ; who will love me in winter , & quot ; & quot ; hold my hand , & quot ; the excellent and aptly named & quot ; highlights , & quot ; and & quot ; seconds of pleasure. & quot ; van hunt produced every note on the disc , and he displays a maturity that belies his 26 years . the cd has an enhanced portion , with links to his official website and there 's also a brief short clip that 's his autobiography . this record may not generate much heat among most mainstream listeners , but this debut makes van hunt a talent to watch . a keeper .

> `` he 's gone '' by deb caletti read more like someone 's rambling diary with a bit of dialogue here and there . it seemed as if the author was really trying to stretch out the story with a lot of empty descriptions and pointless dialogue ( when there was some chit chat going on ) to make a book out of what could have actually been a good short story . after reading about a page worth of rare dialogue about grilled cheese sandwiches it did make me hungry . so i made a grilled cheese sandwich , which i enjoyed immensely.the characters were never fully developed and the story just lacked much depth . any dialogue was superficial at best . the descriptive parts of the book had me imagining each paragraph starting with `` dear diary . `` by the time i got to the end of the book i was losing interest and only wanted to see if there was a point to having started the book . my final thoughts about `` he 's gone '' is i should have closed the book and been gone too .

> the writers go into great detail about the life of a seal . i imagine this book like so many others of the same genres will have its share of bright thirteen year old boys itching to be the best fighting team this country can produce . reading books about seals is what inspired this author at that age to excel at every challenge.without risking military secrets , this is a first hand account on the personal sacrifice that our forces are being used for to accomplish the objective of keeping our country safe . owen called the seal operations to destroy bin laden a political tool but a necessary action.at the end of his book he asks the reader to challenge themselves to contribute to a few charities as a way of thanking the soldiers for their extensive sacrifice . good idea , i wish our government would do a little more of that .

> this game displays many reasons people cite for the downfall of adventure games..dated graphics , frustrating linear gameplay in it 's old school myst presentation , and on top of that it is way too short ... despite all of it 's flaws , this game manages to shine in it 's creepy atmospherics and semi engaging plot , offering a few genuine rare gaming moments of scares..the ending in particular is worth slogging through to..it is unfortunate today that the boundries between vision and execution fall so far apart in adventure games , since this particular genre has often the only games with substance , while their gameplay is completely lacking..hopefully the bridges will become more secure between presenting an engaging , intellegent story inside of an interactive environment , as i would hate for every game out there to digress into a twitch-based bloodbath of pixels..

> real and constance are a power couple . real has made a very good living for himself in the drug trade and his legitimate business , the g-spot , an upscale strip club . by his side , constance is making a name for herself as a realtor dealing only with high-end real estate . in an attempt to get real out of the way , constance is kidnapped and everything goes terribly , terribly wrong from there.emphasis on the superficial and superfluous - big booties , comparisons to actresses like lisa raye and lauren london , exotic features , green eyes , light brown eyes , wavy hair , expensive foreign cars , and million dollar mansions - yep , it 's all here in george sherman hudson 's `` city lights . '' add drug dealers , some strippers and italians and you have a very typical street tale . `` city lights '' was almost a very typical street tale but managed to stay afloat with a good storyline , underlying subplots , interesting characters , good pacing and just enough drama/action . murder and mayhem , greed and betrayal , love and lust , lies and distrust keep readers intrigued . however , also typical of many books today , there were editing issues ranging from lack of punctuation to word confusion ( to/too , was/were ) .though overridden by the obvious , what was good and the potential of more saved this read . not one for sequels ( just say no to sequels ! ) , i am looking forward to seeing what happens next . my suggestion for the author/publisher is to seek the assistance of a good and qualified copyeditor and to do away with the trite clich & eacute ; s. there was a good story here , stick with that and leave the unnecessary behind.and one more thing ... i do n't know what this book 's title had to do with anything . well , two things ... the synopsis did n't quite match the story either.3.75 stars

> couples retreat could have been much funnier , but turns out to be a wannabe of the old fantasy island tv series . one of the lines the welcomes spouts when the couples arrive at `` eden west '' -was we need no money here - only smiles ( gag ) . there were no smiles nor laughs during the movie , just a wild hope throughout that something crazy , zany would happen - it did n't . the humor was lost.vince vaughn was the strongest character , and yet he could not pull humor out of this bland comedy . the cast was topnotch - malin akerman , kristin davis , jason bateman , jon favreau , kristen bell and faizon love but the script did no one justice . eden is the tropical island resort that helps couples work out problems in the marriage . one couple had decided to divorce due to problems conceiving , but this trip was a last chance to make their marriage work . the other three couples enabled all to go half price , but they did not want counseling - they were there to play , to enjoy the sun and jet ski.counseling is mandatory at 6 a.m as a group and then individual couples counseling sessions as well . a satire of psycho-therapists that cause problems or complicate the couples lives ensues - whether steam baths with snow , snorkeling , yoga , new age philosophy , or asian teachings . it becomes too much for all of them , and nothing is helping . soon they all end up on `` eden east '' - the singles side of the island . for some odd reason they all realize what marriage means from that vacuous adventure.if lucy and desi arnez were alive today , they could have made couples retreat a hilarious laugh riot . instead we get very rare funny moments and a bland moral lesson .

> someone recently wrote an article indicating that the sale of romance novels has gone up during this economic slump . people , it seems , want to escape through their reading . since i 'm not a great fan of bodice-rippers i 'd like to suggest that reading a good thriller is a fine way to escape for a while , and to this end try joel goldman 's the dead man.second in the jack davis series this story will capture with the opening pages - a sheriff goes to a brutal murder scene at a farmhouse . a couple is dead , brutally murdered , slaughtered really , rather reminiscent of the clutter killings . but in that case the murderers were caught - in this case they are not.as many will remember jack is a former fbi agent . he suffers from a movement disorder that causes him to shake , thus the fb no longer believes he is capable of service . milo harper runs an institute aimed at helping people control their dreams . however , her institute may now be named in a law suit due to recent deaths of patients.a friend of jack 's recommends him to milo to run security for her . said friend presents this opportunity to jack as the perfect job for him - set your own hours , take breaks whenever you wish , etc . jack 's response is , `` i have n't had a perfect job since sue ellen erickson asked me to carry her books home in the fifth grade . '' nonetheless , he takes the job.it 's not long before he has reason to wish he was back in the fifth grade as his investigation soon reveals that there is a psychotic serial killer on the loose.chock-a-block with danger and fast-paced the dead man will take anyone 's mind off a dwindling bank account , at least for a while.- gail cooke

> what a smart book . after reading it , i read some about the author a little . she mentions growing up in the same area as the paranormal research couple from the conjuring . this is such a perfectly twisty little take on that.sylvie is smart and likable . she is thoughtful and makes a valuable narrator . her parents are interesting . her mother feels very genuine and kind . her dad is a little harder to read . he comes off like a really likable zealot . but there is a lot of evidence to make you wonder . sylvie slowly builds in her own understanding and that lets you get a more well rounded view.rose is miserable . she is supposed to be but sometimes she is a bit much . she is just a bitter angry hateful thing . her parents and her go the rounds but her behavior after their murders is just heartless . her lack of compassion or love for sylvie makes her easy to root against . more is later revealed that explains some of her anger but does n't really justify it . she really is just kind of awful.the twist is fantastic . you can look back and see how it was all carefully laid out but it is certainly not easy to spot . that the story is a reaction to other paranormal stories makes it that much more delicious .

> i 'm stumped as to the appeal of this book and this author . i 'm a big mystery buff and always on the lookout for new writers , and new series to get hooked on . a fellow mystery reading friend had recommended this writer and the blurbs on the cover looked promising ( although by now , i 've become very wary of favorable cover quotes ... inevitably i 'm disappointed ) , one calling this `` a robust series '' and the other bolding stating that `` mcgarrity may be the best writer in the genre working today . '' huh ? that 's not even remotely possible . i could rattle off the names of two dozen very good writers in the crime fiction/mystery genre , ones that can tell a good story and that can write well . based on this one book i 've read by mcgarrity , he does n't do either particularly well . the writting is vanilla and pedestrian . very little atmosphere , descriptive nuance , or emotional impact . the dialogue is also bland and boring . what 's the appeal ? even the `` crime '' is n't that interesting , shocking , or puzzling . this one was a big disappointment .

> the story is set in boston 's brutal underworld , where frank costello ( jack nicholson ) is the all-powerful crime boss . frank mentored a young man ( matt damon ) through the police academy and now he 's both a state trooper and a member of the mob , while the staties have their own man ( leonardo dicaprio ) working inside costello 's organization.this movie is not for the squeamish ; there are almost non-stop bloody killings and barely a line of dialogue that is is n't full of profanities . nicholson chews up the scenery as the ruthless kingpin , wallowing in his magnificent evilness . unfortunately , i could n't quite believe damon and dicaprio as men who could commit such cruel acts ; with their soft babyfaces they looked out of place and when they shared the screen it looked more like a magazine shoot than a shoot out . leo 's bogus attempt at a boston accent also came up short . all of the mobsters mumble , making them hard to understand , but this is a visual story and a striking one at that.the movie is intense and thrilling , but definitely only for those who like tough crime dramas .

> most reviewers describe the hoover clan as dysfuncional which is erroneous . the hoovers are flawed individuals yet somehow cohere as a loving family unit . `` little miss sunshine '' is a celebration of the differences that exist in pretty much all families but are afraid to admit it . the film also succeeds as an indictment of the beauty pageant mentality that perpetuates the jonbenet ramsey syndrome that unfortunately exists in our society . no film has skewered the beauty pageant culture so expertly since michael ritchie 's `` smile '' in 1975. the cast is uniformly excellent but special citations should go to alan arkin and abigail breslin . arkin , whose star rose in the sixties but has kind of waned in recent years , gives a cliche free performance as the drugtaking grandpa . breslin , as olive , has the formidable chore of being the optimistic glue that holds the hoover clan together . the tender scene between arkin and breslin prior to the pageant is heart-rending . i cite arkin and breslin only because that of the cast members they should not be forgotten come oscar time . for that matter the film should n't be forgotten by the academy members either .

> i saw this film only a few years after it was released in theaters . i was not all that impressed , but over the years i 've seen it many times and although i find the story very interesting and the film brave for doing a totally different kind of horror film , i never found this film to be all that frightening . it 's bizarre , yes ! , but the effects are dated and even though the story holds your interest , it moves a little too slowly and could have used a couple of good scares . i guess what is frightening to some will not be to others . i 'm not knocking anyone for loving this film , but i think it 's only fair to point out that this film is n't the kind of `` scary '' that younger movie fans may appreciate . i prefer films like 'the exorcist ' to this film , but it 's not without it 's merits . it 's well over two hours long with very little action and it did hold my interest even though i wanted it to be more intense .

> for any amazon customer looking for a beautiful , basic tablet , you can not go wrong with this . i was very impressed the moment i opened the box . i did end up returning it only because the 10 & # 34 ; form factor was just too big for my purposes , as i was looking for something more portable than my laptop to use in college . if portability is not much of a concern , and you are looking to read ebooks and view other content i have no problem recommending this . although , i have not got one yet , if you are looking for something like this , but are always worried about size there is a 7 & # 34 ; version that might fit for you .
= awesome tablet
< great for the price

> good actors , beautiful girls and my favorite ( but it rarely appears ) the semi truck which is a cool freightliner ( i prefer kw and peterbilt , gmc/chevy ) conventional with big bunk sleeper in this case ( credits : special thanks to freightliner corporation , for a truck that appears briefly in the start and at the end ) , the action and fighting is great , but it makes no sense at all.think of karate kid meets a wizard or something to that effect.it is just bananas , bonkers for a guy like carpenter to bad mouth reagan and the reagan era he sure sold out , why does n't he give up capitalism and product placements ? stick to horror movies .

> boardwalk empire : the birth , high times , and corruption of atlantic city by nelson johnson studies the history , politics , and personalities ( both good and bad ) , that shaped and influenced atlantic city during the years of the twentieth century . ranging from corrupt crime bosses , to the influence of republican politics , to the present day characterization of atlantic city as a haven for entertainment and gambling , boardwalk empire is an absorbing , informative , and at times startling chronicle of an american city . boardwalk empire is a strongly recommended addition to political science and 20th century american history collections .

> you do n't run into to many people that seem over the edge with theories on conspiracies . mel gibson , julia roberts , and patrick stewart all do great jobs in their roles . gibson is good as the slightly crazy taxi driver with all kinds of theories on government agencies . roberts is a believable department of justice agent . stewart does well as the cia operative with questionable methods of programming agents . not a bad government cover up action thriller . i recommend as a rental before purchasing . the set that includes this and tequila sunrise is a good value .

> the wave : in pursuit of the rogues , freaks and giants of the ocean tells of sailors who have reported 100-foot and high waves appearing from nowhere : legends which scientists once dismissed as impossible . proof arrived in 2000 when a british research vessel was trapped in the north sea in a vortex of mammoth waves . the science of giant waves - and the interest extreme surfers take in them - is presented in a lively survey following surf riders and the giant waves that draw them . riveting reading : every library should have this !

> it 's entertainment , and is n't trying to present itself as anything else , unlike some so-called newscasters , commentators , etc. , op-ed writers . but there is enough truth beneath the attitudes , behavior , and overall setting to make it feel real . i 'm sure some people will be insulted , but parody has to hit home somewhere to be good parody . and this is very good .

> the display is nice to look at but the weather is inaccurate . i compare it to the weather channel app and it is always off , i would n't mind it it was telling me it was colder than it is and then i was pleasantly surprised but it tells me its going to be warmer than it is , and so i 'm always disappointed : (

> in the time since jack bauer ( kiefer sutherland ) was kidnapped , the united states has become a dangerous place . suicide bombers hit the country on a regular basis , and no one is safe . new president wayne palmer ( d. b. woodside ) has arranged jack 's release from a chinese prison camp . jack is to be traded to the terrorists in exchange for a promised cease fire.jack agrees to give his life for the peace of his country . but when he finds out that it was all a lie , he escapes to begin another cat and mouse hunt with the terrorists . only this time , they 've already struck once , leading to a calamity . meanwhile , the trail leads jack to his own family . what secrets are his dad and brother hiding ? can he stop the terrorists before they unleash even more terror on america ? and more importantly , what happened to this once great show ? i 've been a fan of this show since season one . while my favorite season was the third , i 've thought all of the previous seasons were great . but not this one.part of the problem was the been there , done that factor . the writers seem to be out of plot twists , so they are relying on the same one stand bys . unfortunately , loyal viewers can see those coming . there was very little here that we had n't seen before , which made the season boring.the other big problem was the dropped storylines . several times , a story was introduced and dropped in a matter of episodes . sometimes , they came back , sometimes they did n't , leaving us hanging . add to that the increase of personal drama over suspense , and you 've got a lack luster season.now , it was n't all bad . this season was still entertaining . but compared to the previous years , day six was a real let down .

> ( available in both hard cover and paperback ) pack your imaginary bags and get ready to join constable hamish macbeth as he solves yet another crime in the picturesque village of lochdubh in the scottish highlands in this the latest installment in the hamish macbeth mystery series.when hopeless dreamer effie garrard moves to lochdubh , apparently all she wants is to unleash her creativity as a painter , but it soon becomes clear that 's not the only item in her subconscious and very unstable agenda . she begins having trouble with villagers and visitors alike . in fact , she is not liked at all . then she is found dead.the shocking news spread quickly , for how can such a horrible incident occur in such a picturesque little village ? is it suicide ... or murder ? that is for constable macbeth to find out . unfortunately for him , the suspects are as devious , unexpected and peculiar as lochdubh itself . fortunately for you , the list of suspects is long enough to keep you guessing until the end.there is a charming -- and even childlike -- simplicity in the author 's writing style that adds to the folksy flavour of the setting , plot and protagonist . beaton uses mostly dialogue to move the story and does n't waste time with needless descriptions or character ruminations , which slows the pace.constable hamish macbeth , with his fiery red hair , reputation with the ladies , and love for his two eccentric pets , is an original and adorable protagonist . his is an unusual combination of unpretentious charm , naivete , a hot temperament , and genial deduction.death of a dreamer is perfect to cuddle up with on those cold rainy days in front of a roaring fireplace , or in any place , for that matter.armchair interviews says : a thoroughly enjoyable cozy mystery .

> salander , the transcendent female character created by steig larson , is a breakthrough for female literary protagonists . what 's more - she 's really fun to read about . larson tells an compelling story in the girl with the dragon tattoo . the story is set in sweden amidst the financial & magazine publishing world . blomkvist , a most likable reporter , has been recently busted for a journalist no-no . apparently , he wrote an article full of charges against a formidable company that he simply can not prove . in his despair , he takes an unlikely job , working for the head of a major corporation who wants blomkvist to write his family 's memoirs as a ruse to uncovering some family secrets long since buried.as blomkvist starts to make progress on the mystery , upsetting the extended family in the process , and finds himself in need of the very specific skills of salander . they meet , they work together and they tussle a bit . read the book to see how this unlikely pair attempt to solve the mystery and turn their own personal and professional lives around in the process.the girl with the dragon tattoo is perfectly paced and painstakingly developed mystery complete with suspense and romance . you are going to love it . luckily the salander character makes a reappearance in larson next two books . lucky us !

> about 5 years ago the british film institute ran a poll of the greatest british films of all-time . this film placed high in the poll , above the likes of `` a hard days night '' and `` a clockwork orange '' to name a few . `` empire '' , the british film magazine , on the dvd release of the film called it a `` bank holiday classic '' . let 's just say that while this is far from a bad film , something must be lost in the translation . this film concerns itself with an elaborate plot to steal gold bullion from a military convoy through the crowded streets of turin , italy during a football match between the u.k. and italy . the caper itself is amazingly well crafted . the crew 's escape through a traffic jam in british mini coopers is even more impressive . what this film lacks in my mind is any characters that would give you some emotional attachment . michael caine is the star here and leader of the crew and he is suave , but a little too detached for my liking . the american remake that came out last year did a better job at crafting empathetic characters . on a final note this film has a strange cliffhanger ending that will leave you scratching your head .

> i thought i 'd seen all i needed to see of vampire films but bigelow 's & quot ; near dark & quot ; surprised me . she set it in the american southwest , among cowboys , ranchers and vagabonds . she also came up with some of most visually stunning images of vampires ever put on film , especially of them catching on fire . amazingly , she even comes up with a way to redeem the protagonist in the film who was unwillingly made into a vampire . writer-director kathryn bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director . it shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking . she is a breath of fresh air in this genre , investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery . her most frequent producer is james cameron ( the action wonder king , & quot ; titanic , & quot ; & quot ; terminator & quot ; ) , who is also her ex-husband . you can see his influence on her work as well .
= artistic vampires on fire

> this is n't a bad book . but reading it will not send you to the head of the class . you probably wo n't even become enlightened as to why the person in the next cube , who is n't nearly as smart as you , gets promoted and you don't.what you will get from this book is knowledge of the results of lots and lots of studies and articles on competition . some of the cited works are twisted beyond recognition to make the authors ' point . some are merely window dressing . factoids and tidbits abound . did you know that people who participate in dog shows spend around $ 330 million a year in show-related expenses ? there 's a lesson about competition to be learned from dog shows ! fortunately the authors have a sense of humor and deliver their message - that competition is natural and good for us - with a deft touch.i did n't learn anything startlingly new from reading `` top dog '' , but i definitely enjoyed the read . lots of new tidbits to be gleaned , even if no significant insights.jerry
= will reading this book make a difference in your life ? probably not .
< a lesson about competition

> for some reason - do n't ask me why - i did n't have very high expectations for this book after reading portions of the book 's description , and seeing as how i picked this up for free during a kindle promotion i almost moved on to something else when i was looking at my electronic `` to be read '' pile on my kindle : i 'm glad i decided to read it , as it was a very good `` hard '' science fiction that blends in a little technology , action and adventure , with various aliens thrown into the mix . the author does a good job of weaving a tale that you do n't want to put down , and in my case i stayed up really late one night reading this as i lost all track of time - i 've already purchased the next book in the series ! i picked this book up during a free kindle promotion , and as i type this review the pricing is now $ 2.99 : if you enjoy good science fiction this one is worth it .
= nice sci-fi story

> i had a samsung tab before but with my amazon prime membership , i thought that the kindle would be a better match . it is ! the 8.9 & # 34 ; display is crystal clear , the battery life is extensive , the lending library is super , the only thing i miss is flash for specific websites and the inability to load an alternate browser . some sites do n't recognize silk and wo n't display content . the amazon store has lots of apps and they seem to be more well tested than the play store . there are ways to get non-amazon content but the apps are not as reliable . i miss zinio , too but got it working with a few glitches . so - would i buy it again - yes . do i wish i had bought something else - not now . i do lust after technology and in an ideal world i would have all the tablet formats but that 's not going to happen .

> if you only have 10-minutes to workout or you want to add a pilates routine after walking or a cardio session , this denise austin dvd gives you 7 10-minute target workouts or you can select specific workouts and play them all at once . you can also choose to exercise for 30 minutes , either focusing on the abs and waist line or lower body . there is also a 15-minute pilates challenge.the intermediate pace makes this an invigorating workout routine and denise 's `` double the workout in half the time '' exercise are unique and creative . while this is mostly pilates , there are a few yoga poses . denise austin also takes familiar exercises and combines them or increases the challenge.i am finding this dvd to be most useful as a customizable routine . this allows for more variety and that makes exercising more fun . the new denise austin dvds are encouraging , vibrant and very enjoyable . the outdoor settings are healing and the exercises are creative.~the rebecca review

> this is the 4th of the series ( starting with city of pearl ) and is not a stand alone book at all , though it does start with a brief summation to bring you up to date , i do n't think that that would be sufficient for a new reader.the pace is slower than the previous books but still engrossing . shan strikes a few repetitive notes , but her dilemma is real and tragic - the 'gift ' of immortality via the alien viral symbiot , and how to stop humans from exploiting it . the comparisons between humans and the other alien organizations/cultures continues to be interesting . i 'm starting book 5 today , so clearly i 'm on the bandwagon . i realized i was so obsessed with these books , i did n't even look to see if my local library has them ( it does ) i just ordered them off amazon straight away . so you can tell i think they 're keepers !

> johnny cash / a hundred highways / american v ( american recordings ) : this album is painfully good . the man had lost his wife ( june carter cash ) and in this cd he sings of loss , faith , and love . the loss of june and his own impending death shows in his nearly tortured voice and yet , he gives us this gift of pure brilliance . johnny finished his vocals but died before the album was completed . the huge hit here is his `` god 's gon na cut you down '' which is a warning to repentance that in 2011 was ( inexplicably ) being used as the background of a television car commercial ( some folks never learn ) . this is another masterpiece . this one deserves a sixth star .
= recorded after june 's death and finished after johnny 's death
< a masterpiece

> i really liked this movie . i think there was some issues with the way it was released and some extras but i honestly do n't sit there and watch all the commentary . if i missed an extra i probably would n't have noticed anyway . the movie is visually great and the acting is well done . there is an excess of lens flares and jj abrams has actually apologized for this . he just loves them i guess . i thought the movie had a ton of action and suspense and was overall a really good movie . nothing great , like it will change your life or something , but it is worth the couple of hours .
= great action/sci-fi movie with beautiful animation

> in cynical fashion , the major studios churn out needless remakes aimed at young moviegoers who lack imagination to track down the originals . the latest casualty is `` the wicker man '' - writer-director neil labute 's desecration of the 1973 british horror favorite . like most contemporary remakes , it has been justly ignored . hollywood 's creative bankruptcy never ceases to astonish me .

> the case is a bright white that certainly fits the gs3 very tight ( a good thing ) . the issue is that the cut out holes for things like the micro usb and headphone jack are slightly off . it 's not bad enough rendering these slots unusable but it is a bit of a downer to an otherwise very nice case .

> i have a habit of reading several books simultaneously . i like my reading to fit my mood and my situation . for example , i do n't read anything riveting at bedtime . i want something soothing and comforting , like jane austen . i will read several books that `` go together '' ( in theme ) at the same time . i have always done this . the down side of that is that books end up inadvertently abandoned all over the house and sometimes in the car , often for weeks at a time . by the time i stumble upon them again , i do n't remember my place in the book.the kindle has solved all that for me . now , i can be in the middle of dozens of different books and jump back into whatever suits me , whenever i like.i can also search a book to find the passage that i loved best , just to re-read it . so , i am half in love with my kindle . i know i 'm reading more and finishing more of what i read.the down side ? a lot of my favorite books are actually not yet available on the kindle . and , the ones that are available tend to cost more on the kindle . this is a disappointment . but , its my own fault for not researching this better before asking santa for a kindle . ( thanks santa ! ) but , i hope that , as time goes by , more of my favorite books will be available for the kindle . and , until then , the fact that there are so many great free books ( classics ! ) available on the kindle , sort of makes up for it .

> judging by the results of two recent polls , business owners , executives and managers have plenty of worries . roughly three-quarters of the u.s. workforce is actively seeking other employment and 85 % of the world 's employees are not motivated enough to put in extra effort at work . loyalty and job satisfaction are clearly problems . but adrian gostick and chester elton strongly believe they have the solution . in analyzing the results of a groundbreaking 10-year study , the authors conclude that employee recognition is the key to boosting staff morale and involvement . their book explains why managers who are strong in four basic categories - `` goal setting , communication , trust and accountability '' - invariably have happier employees and get better business results . the authors support their theory with first-hand accounts from a variety of workers and organizations . the book even includes a chapter with 125 really cool recognition ideas . we believe this book should vault to the top of any manager 's must-read list , especially if you find it hard to give praise where praise is due . highly recommended .

> i love everything about this case . the color is less saturated than the picture , which i love . the contrast of the pink and gray looks great on my white phone . i purchased this for iphone 4 and it fits perfectly . i like that this case is both plastic and silicone . i would recommend watching the video for how to put it on . i was successful in getting on in one try after watching it . it was a little hard to figure out without it . if you are looking for a case with a built in screen protector like i was , this is the case for you . i think it will make the phone virtually indestructable ! the best part about this case was the price . they sell these at the verizon store and online at verizonwireless.com , but the price there is $ 49.99 . i paid half that with shipping ! deifinately will buy one again if i ever need to . highly encourage you to go for it !

> these sound really good with my computer ! i am in a fairly large size office in my home and having six speakers just makes a rich sounding music or stereo sound for a movie . these 70 watts of total power speakers just rock in a 5.1 surround sound mode . they are easily set up and provide a good experience when used for a tv or computer system.the speakers that are provided are 4 satellites , 1 center speaker and 1 subwoofer . you also get a control center and the cables are color coded for fast wiring and installation . the set comes with a 2 year warranty and i like the construction . the cable lengths were ok for my installation but you may in some cases find them to be a little short , especially the rear speakers.this set of speakers is worth the money as they produce high quality sound that is crisp and clean . i enjoy mine .

> the latest quirky food book by michael pollan is titled , cooked : a natural history of transformation . pollan explores the ways in which the fundamental elements of fire , water , earth and air can transform things that are great to eat and drink . the process of cooking with these elements also transformed pollan and the ways he cooks , and can transform a reader 's connection to the food and drink we consume . the structure of the book presents how pollan tries to master one recipe using each of the four elements . i liked his writing and enjoyed reading about the adventures he pursued in cooking . foodies and those who love cooking are those readers most likely to enjoy this book . also , if you watch the food network or any cooking shows , you 'll probably like this book.rating : four-star ( i like it )

> this is just a great toy . ours has gone through 4 children , 3 of them boys , and it 's still like new . little tikes makes things that last forever and this is no exception . the trays snap off for easy cleanup , but stay on when needed by children . it 's just so much fun for them to be able to draw on one side and paint on the other at the same time . we buy the finger paint sets and use the paper that is included in them and also , they make extra paper sets sold separately that provides the slippery side needed for finger painting . i love how easily this easel cleans up and requires very little maintenance . a great buy for a lot of fun !
= most durable one out there - like new after 4 children !

> boulez conducts a cool reading without a trace of hungarian passion or gothic melodrama , both of which are prominent in any really fine performance . his soloists are vocally suited to their parts , but norman applies her usual generic grand aloofness and plush vocalism to a role that calls for vulnerability and awe changing to horror , while polgar simply is n't a major artist in any way.bluebeard 's castle has attracted magnificent interpretations over the years , and the fact that great singers like fischer-dieskau , walter berry , christa ludwig , samuel ramey , and anne sophie von otter have given their all makes this version , despite its good qualities , pretty unnecessary .

> i received this item for christmas ( it was on my wishlist ) . for years , i have lamented selling my old-fashioned kitchen scale . i ca n't tell you how many recipes call for ingredients by pound , or how often i 've wanted to weigh something around the house ... the bathroom scale just does n't do the trick . this scale is so easy to use . just two buttons . one lets you pick pounds , kilograms , or ounces and the other lets you tare out a bowl or other container . that 's it . i love this scale for it 's simplicity .

> these neodymium magnets are very strong and two easily hold up a piece of paper on the refrigerator . they make everything look better and more organized . since they are so small they leave room to see what you have displayed . perfect for pictures or notes or just about anything you want to attach to the refrigerator . i would not recommend you use these near the bottom of the refrigerator if you have pets or kids who could get them and swallow them . they are really , really tiny.~the rebecca reviewi received these magnets free for review . this review is my honest opinion .

> i love this game . for those whose kids are buying coins , either dont let them play or make sure they know not to . all free apps have things you can buy , therefore they are able yo make something.. not fair to the creators that you gave a bad review because you do n't control your children . also to those that can not get out without shutting off the kindle , use your brain , hit options and what do you know the bar magically reappears . give me a break people . its a great free game to waste time with .

> mayme johnson , bumpy johnson 's wife of twenty years , decided it was time to set the record straight . in harlem godfather , she does just that , providing readers an intimate and in depth look into the infamous bumpy johnson , his life and his character.make no mistake ; this is n't a wife 's dreamy version of her husband 's life , delicately covering the dark patches with a flowery illusion . no , by the end of the first chapter , you instinctively realize mayme johnson is a straight shooter and is giving you the truth , with all the fat trimmed away.bumpy johnson was harlem . period . here , he becomes more than a conflicted character in hoodlum or a blatant misrepresentation in american gangster . here , his charisma and creativeness prove he should be acknowledged with all the great bosses of the `` mafia '' heyday.was he a criminal ? yes , but boy , did he run it with style and finesse , a true `` sporting man '' as mayme johnson calls them . it is that style , loyalty , cleverness and simple luck , which fixates mainstream america . bumpy battled dutch schultz , played chess and bargained with lucky luciano and rubbed elbows with hollywood stars and starlets , but would pull out his switchblade and slash a guy without a second thought.while mayme johnson provided an insightful and comprehensive journey of her husband 's life , karen quinones miller did a masterful job of seamlessly molding the pieces together in this flawless work . the amount of research , time and effort put here can not go unnoticed . karen quinones miller undoubtedly filled in the blanks , providing the political and historical climate , which enriched the telling of bumpy johnson 's life.mayme johnson 's candor is refreshing , and the simplicity with which she and karen quinones miller deliver this complicated biography is wonderful.reviewed by a. kaifor the rawsistaz reviewers

> use it and you will never go back to roku , or chrome or any of the others . it 's lightening quick on amazon prime streaming and netflix . the voice search on amazon ( and soon on netflix ) is quick and i have n't had an error yet ! i even bought a controller because i can play the original tetris on it ( it 's tetris so i ca n't speak to amazing game play , but i 'm pleased with the way tetris is the regular console game and it still winds up beating me ! ! ! ! ! ! ) . i think gamers will be happy tho . but the basic box is amazing . the picture is great it provides the source sound as well . the only thing you might want to know is that you ca n't turn it off except by unplugging it ! i do consider this a negative and ca n't imagine why they left it out of the design . but the box does go to sleep after 30 minutes of no activity . so just change your video source , put the remote away and it 'll sleep quietly until you need it again . i 'm not deducting a star because i 'm sure they 'll realize their mistake and correct it in future versions , but even now it 's only a mild annoyance and the speed of instant streaming makes up for it and then some . it 's truly amazing and you have to see it for yourself . in other words , despite that one minor flaw , i highly recommend fire tv !

> this `` animal adventure learning table '' is the perfect size for both of my twin seven month old grandchildren to play with - at the same time . their eyes got big and round when they saw the toy and they both started laughing when they heard it for the first time.the toy is very durable . so far the twins are using it flat on the floor but it will only be a few more weeks , i think , until the legs go on and they pull up to the table and use it to try to stand.i love the music aspect ( loud but not overpowering ) plus there is a volume button ( two positions on the on-off switch ) . the middle position is less loud than the far right position.both twins love the mirror under the hippo head and they love pounding on the center `` drum . '' they are n't old enough yet to do the other activities , like the spinning guitar or flipping the pages by the giraffe or using the slide button by the tiger but they are n't very far away from being able to do these things and this table will definitely help them learn.this table will also help with motor control , color , letters , numbers and shapes along with the music.i love this product and would recommend it to anyone with small children . it is recommended for children 6 months to 3 years and that seems about right to me .

> although this fine lens is optically based on the famous contax carl zeiss 85mm f1.4 , its digital performance is more reminiscent of a medium telephoto lens , than that of a fast portrait ( short telephoto ) lens since its 35mm equivalent focal length is nearly 130mm . i was able to handle it at this year 's photo plus east , the annual photography and digital imaging trade show held at new york city 's javitts center , and was impressed with its overall handling , especially its swift , almost silent , autofocusing . having used zeiss lenses for more than fifteen years , i have no doubt that this new lens is as optically superb as its manual focus equivalent that 's available now for nikon f-mount 35mm slr cameras ( the new zeiss zf ( nikon f-mount ) 85mm f1.4 planar lens is optically superior to the earlier contax version that i own. ) . this lens - and other current and future zeiss lenses for the sony alpha system - is most likely being assembled by sony at either its own lens manufacturing plant - or tamron 's ( a wholly owned subsidary of sony ) - at least some of the components , especially its lens elements are being shipped from zeiss 's oberkochen , germany headquarters - under strict zeiss supervision , including quality control .

> this one was recommended to me so i checked it out . i was almost tempted to turn it off . but by hanging in until the end it all made sense.a brilliant orphan is almost too old to be adopted . his desire to invent has a way of driving off the prospects . but then at a science fair another kid takes him to the future . here we meet the robinsons , a very crazy and eccentric group who seem to be around just to supply crazy scene after crazy scene . there have been plenty of crazy families in the past but this one takes the prize . but if you can sit through the disjointed scenes , singing frogs , flying hats , crazy personalities , and lack of plot , you are rewarded with a neat little bundle at the end that ties it all together with some back to the future type cleverness.this is a very unusual film . the long plotless sections combined with the wild animation make for a very unique experience . this is sort of like an agatha christie mystery when it does n't make any sense until the parlor scene . bear with it and you should enjoy it . if not , it will just seem like a bunch of vignettes . brace yourself and check it out .

> since 1969 , uriah heep has been delivering its unique artistry with numerous personnel changes . and there is something about a band that forges ahead , while not becoming an `` oldies '' relic that is content to allow fm classic rock formats to keep the name alive for tours to smaller and smaller venues.with original band member mick box and trevor bolder - whose work dates back to the 1970s - there is a solid connection to the past , but the tracks ( with new drummer russell gilbrook ) are solid additions to an expansive discography , while showing solid direction to the future.up-tempo numbers wake the sleeper , overload and tears of the world deliver a foundation , but it 's the slower pace of light of a thousand stars and the final pair of numbers - shadow , war child - that finds the band taking impressive artistic steps that can be a primer for any established rock group seeking to maintain relevance in the `` modern '' world of pop culture.the first studio release since 1998 , uriah heep shows that a sleeping giant can still crank out quality numbers , with an energy and vision that sets a pace ... against the odds .

> i saw this film at the theater when it was first released and i have seen it numerous times on tv , but this was the first time i watched the 2 disc special edition ( actually the 9 disc box set ) in my home theater and i must say i was very impressed ! the transfer is exceptional and the movie has never looked better . there are more than a few good scares in this well made sci-fi horror story and like a low boiling pot the film just slowly intensifies ! the acting is also well above average for such saturday afternoon fare and weaver is perfectly cast as ripley . alien is really a remake of a 50 's sci-fi film `` it the terror from beyond space '' , but only takes a great idea to another level . the box set is incredible and a worthy purchase for fans of the series . if you are not a fan of the entire series then buy the two disc set of the first two films . `` in space no one can hear you scream !

> leaving the topic of the killing of jesus to a historical genre does not leave you without the need to confront who was jesus , but it allows you to do so without what some might call the miracle nonsense . even just a historical presentation leaves you wondering how a man from a rural nowhere could have had such an amazing effect on the folks who knew him , either in fear or in an amazing sense that jesus was the christ . anyone interested in the `` real '' jesus will find that this book will present `` the facts '' about the death of jesus , but that does not mean it looses the challenge of wondering if this historical jesus is far more than a mere man .

> bob dylan / world gone wrong : in hindsight , we now can see that this album was a result of his research into older traditional songs , which would bring fruition in his great albums of the late 1990 's . however , this ` research ' album is not very good . dylan garbles his way through these songs with little interest in performance . it makes one wonder if he ever intended these songs for public release . still , it is an interesting album solely for it 's historical value as a key to dylan 's later albums but it has very little entertainment value . i give this a generous three stars

> `` pulse '' by h.j . daly was given to me by the author for an honest review and i must thank her for the great entertainment this book has provided.this is a great fantasy story and an enjoyable and easy read.set in england after a big war that leaves the country vulnerable to crime and chaos our heroine esa is left to fight for her own . during a big war some weapon has affected the boundaries between realms . it is a world of goblins , sorcerers and elfs . sorcerer alphamor is chasing esa 's friend rootu and she helps him to cross the mark /a boundary to return to his realm . there other characters joining them in the battle against the sorceer and the goblins , the classical fight between good and evil forces.the first thing i noticed was how beautiful the language is , very appropriately used for a fantasy novel , and the dialogues are very well written.the characters are well chosen and all have some substance to them , making their relationships with each other and the reasons behind their actions credible . esa in particular as the tough loner is very convincing as the hardened up heroine that is willing to help but worries that her trust may be broken . the suspense is nicely built up and the plot keeps moving along , never allowing for a dull moment . i personally would have liked a few things exlained in more detail , such as the war , esa 's family background and the pulse from the title that had such an impact but apart from such minor issues daly shows great talent and this is a book that fantasy lovers should find easy to enjoy .

> i finished this book at 2am last night . my eyes are puffy and swollen this morning but well worth it . i loved this book ! i cried i think the last quarter of the book . i just had to finish it . 5 giant stars from me . so far this is my favorite book of the year ! let me just say i 'm an emotional reader . i can cry at any sad scene but this book broke my heart . i felt so drawn to sky 's character she was such a strong women and i loved her . i was pulled in from the very beginning and was dreading a little when holder was showing that he was a little stalker-ish and had a temper . i do n't relate well to those kind of male characters and i tend to be a bit harsh on my ratings if i do n't think the lead guy is all that worthy of my heroine . sky stood her ground with holder and did n't put up with his crap and let him know he was in the wrong . i loved that sky did n't just run into his arms even though she wanted too . as the story progressed the more holder grew on me and by the middle of the book i think i was just as infatuated with him as sky was . there were times i found the story a little bit predictable i knew things that would happen in the near future . they did happen just not how i was expecting them . i loved it and it will be a book that i will remember for a very long time !

> the production value and special effects are just ridiculously good , especially for its time . the casts chemistry and characters are top notch . i 'm blown away that fox did n't renew this . it 's like this amazing gem that they had no idea what they held . i hope the guy that canceled it got fired long ago . i get that it 's about ratings , but any fool can see firefly would have eventually caught on big when more people found out about it . some of the biggest shows ever can take a second season before they become noticed and take off . if fox had any sense they would have recognized it was worth hanging onto it longer and pushing it better . i feel bad i did n't support it when it came out . i remember the commercials well , i just thought it was something different than it was from what i saw back then . eventually i would have started watching when i figured it out . as i 'm sure many others would . but we never got the chance . it 's like one of tv 's biggest tragedies that there were not more seasons . it feels so strange how amazing the world is they put together , and that 's it , just basically half a season . just ends right there . and you are thinking , how in the world can this be all there is to this amazing universe ? well they had a great movie that wrapped things up nice . would have been better though to see that all play out ( and more ) over a few more seasons though .

> i bought this book on kindle , enjoyed it , and recommend it.the book focuses on the character in john grisham 's first novel , a young man who defended a black man in mississippi in 1985 who shot and killed white men who raped his daughter . it is now three years later . he receives a letter in the mail from a man who was impressed with how he handled this case and hiring him to handle his will . the man wrote a will and then hung himself . his estate is worth some $ 24 million . he is white and he left all of his money except for $ 1 million each to charity and his long lost brother to his black maid . he disinherited his children and grandchildren . he hung himself because he could no longer stand the pain of the cancer that was killing him . our hero faces some very skilled devious attorneys who are determined to prove that the deceased was out of his mind , that the court should toss out this handwritten will , and accept instead an earlier will that gave his estate to his family .
= a really enjoyable tale with very interesting characters

> tess gerritsen strays from her usual medical thriller . this is more like a sci-fi thriller , with medical overtones . she is one of my favorite authors and am i glad that she gave up her internist career for one in writing . the world has so many internists but only a few truly good writers.so what 's good about this book ? the setting for one , an isolated space station . this is no different from your isolated mansion or runaway train or isolated island . it 's a well used and often used plot setting , but scary all the same as the characters are isolated from any help . someone can eventually get to the mansion or stop the train , but being in outer space is as isolated as you can get.the plot keeps you guessing til the end , i wo n't reveal too much here . the characters are well fleshed out and keep your goose pimpled as they die off one by one . this one kept me up well past bed time . a solid 10/10 .
= excellent !

> elliot goldenthal , the scorer of movies such as `` heat '' and `` titus , '' comes back with a brilliant blend of traditional mexican and original latin music to go with one of the best movies of 2002 : julie taymor 's `` frida , '' which earned him a golden globe this year . the soundtrack as a whole is simply outstanding , yet it has some peak moments : lila downs ' performances , most specifically the opening track , 'benediction and dream , ' the sexy tango 'alcoba azul ' and the theme that plays during the closing titles , 'burn it blue ' which she performs with brazilian super-star , caetano veloso . also the rendition of `` la llorona '' by chavela vargas is outstanding . the tracks that are part of his score work are also outstanding , and reminded me a lot of the music from the album `` ronroco '' by argentinian composer and producer , gustavo santaolallas . all in all , a very eclectic and hypnotizingly beautiful soundtrack with supreme good taste .
= hypnotizing , beautiful and now , winner of a golden globe !

> this a a great game on the kindle fire . it plays well and is a fast action game . i was glad to see this sega game as the faotd as my grandson loves playing this game . he is much better at it than i am . running full speed it is hard for me to anticipate what is coming up on a 7 inch kindle fire screen so you may have to play some levels several times until you get the game timing correct.this is a lot of fun to play and getting used to playing it on a tablet was fast and easy . the controls responded quickly and the graphics and sound are well done . the game is professionally designed and plays smoothly and is very enjoyable to play . i like the game a lot and i rated it as a 5 star item .

> there is no question that there is a shortage of good music that was released in the past several years . but there really have been some surprises that were sure to knock you off your feet . for newcomers foster the people , they have had a surprise that really was a great classic for 2011. pumped up kicks , the first mainstream single from foster the people actually is a delightful song . it brings back a sound similar to what was strong back in the 60 's and 70 's with music back then . it is a delightful diddy that works well from the song , to the vocals from the group . i hope there is more from foster the people soon . it should be more that you can feel pumped up about.song : b

> it has been a while since i read a book in which harry bosch was the central character but the screen bosch does n't seem to match the book version . it would n't be the first time , of course . i was n't too taken with the character 's lack of concern or reactions to the civil suit brought about by his shooting of an apparently unarmed suspect . he seems to treat it simply as a minor distraction or everyday occurance instead of an event that could ruin his career/reputation and destroy him financially.granted there is not much he can do to help but you would think he would be enlisting colleagues in helping him prove that the person he shot had a gun at the scene . maybe as the story evolves ... .

> i am by far the least technologically knowledgeable person in my family ; do n't want to know how something works - just want it to work when i plug it in.after loading the creative soundblaster x-fi into my toshiba laptop , i have noticed a remarkable change in the quality of sound of my movies , music , and i-tunes ; the high pitched background noise and feedback i used to notice with my headphones seems to have disappeared.the only thing that i do n't really like is how bulky the unit is , and as others have pointed out , a sound dial on top makes it difficult to stack and save space on my desktop .

> at first i did n't like this filter as much as the red solofil model . it is harder to clean and lets larger grinds through . i was hoping that the `` laser '' ( dr. evil version quotes ) would be finder than the mesh used by the solofil.now that this model can be used with filters i 'm pretty excited about it . i 'll have much better coffee , less waste than brewing or k-cups , and the cleanup will be easier too ! too bad their out of stock at the moment .

> i ordered this pedometer to get a feel for how much i walk/run in an average day . it keeps track of your aerobic minutes and your normal walking miles/steps . the calorie counter is also a nice bonus ( though i 'm not burning as much as i 'd like ; ) ) . it is surprisingly accurate and actually a great little motivator . it fits easily in my purse or bookbag , and i now carry it with me always . it is definitely worth it ! ! ! !

> how fun to have a remote controlled helicopter that shoots missiles ! this chopper shoots circular disk foams and battles with an ai equipped tower that shoots back at it . you need a learning curve if this is your first time flying a chopper but things gets a lot more fun once you master the controls.the tower is huge . it looks for the chopper while it flies through the air , once it detects its enemy , it will shoot one missile at a time . you can also control the tower manually for a two-player mode using the control pad at the back . the control pad is detachable for easier control although it is still tethered by a wire and not completely wireless.the firing response seems to lag by a second from the time i press the trigger to the actual launch of a missile . although the tower is big , it is hard to aim and make a direct hit because you need to fire at the right height ; you can not tilt the chopper 's nose up and down . the tower always look for the chopper even when it is just on the ground . while on air , the chopper never got hit by the tower even it is almost stationary in front of it , which is a letdown.both the tower and the chopper requires a total of ten batteries , so make sure you have a stock of aas ; they are not included . my son was very excited when we received it but unboxing it is a pain . you have to deal with so many cables before you can completely remove everything . the tower also accepts regular nerf bullets which is a good thing as we have 4 mavericks and a load of supply of bullets .

> gopicnic provides a fast healthy lunch without the guilt . it 's vegan friendly and does not require refrigeration , heating , or even knife and fork . ( i do recommend napkins for the hummus ) the lunch comes in an attractive recyclable box with an assortment of snack size items amounting to 380 calories . 110 of those calories are from fat , but those fats are healthy fats . 45 grams of carbs , with 12 of those grams being fiber . best yet , there are no trans-fats , high fructose corn syrups , or msg . some of the products are no gluten as well.lavash honey and flax crackers : thin and delicious wafers that are satisfying and filling.hummus : crushed garbanzo bean dip . it 's creamy with a nice tart lemony taste and excellent on the crackers.edamame ( roasted green soynuts ) : the nuts provided a satisfying crunch without a lot of sodium or fat . they are an acquired taste , i am sure . you 'd have to pack a pint of water to go with them , they 're so dry.almond roca : a tiny bar , but very delicious.dried cranberries and pineapple : this is a delicious combination that i would definitely have never thought of . just enough for a tasty finish to the meal . best part of the whole package.as a finisher , they 've provided a lemon-scented wet wipe which is great for cleaning up your hands.the only part of this meal i did n't finish was the edamame . while they probably would make a great snack , they just were not to my taste.this is one product i will actually be looking for because the quality and taste of the individual ingredients is excellent and the lunch is convenient.rebecca kyle , january 2010

> found in a dingo pen at the wildlife park , toby wakes up in a hospital with no memory of what happened . nothing seems to be physically wrong with toby , and the doctors have no explanation for the episode or than possible epilepsy . when a strange note left on toby 's hospital bed says that a priest claims to know about toby 's affliction , his mother thinks the priest is crazy . but when a young man named reuben claims to have the same condition , toby 's denial slowly turns around when meeting a group of reuben 's odd friends . and when toby is kidnapped by violent men , he realizes the truth too late - that he 's a werewolf.toby and his friends are rebellious teens with a penchant for home-made explosives and mischief . but when toby is kidnapped and thrown in a cell , he gets serious and uses his cleverness to try to escape . suddenly his life is changed , and with it , his priorities . my only complaint is that we never experience any werewolf actually transforming . there is no `` wolfing out '' in this story . it 's only referred to . but after toby is kidnapped , there is no lack of excitement and suspense . this is a sequel to the reformed vampire support group , but this is a separate story , and i did n't find it confusing at all . those that have read the first will just know several of the minor characters a bit better . with plenty of humor , mystery , and heart-pounding suspense - the abused werewolf rescue group is an entertaining read for fans of werewolf and vampire novels .

> forensic psychologist , amanda bell brown , affectionately known as bell , soon realizes after her marriage to detective jazz , she was emotionally and spiritually unprepared for marriage and this caused a strain in their relationship . jazz left her when he found out she ran to the place she always felt safe ; her ex-lover , rocky . however , they remain madly in love with each other.rocky invites bell to attend a revival conference featuring the flamboyant and charming former television evangelist , ezekial thunder . because of thunder 's checkered past , bell reluctantly agrees to attend . when a horrible accident happens in the thunder household , bell suspects ezekial 's young wife , nikki . bell investigates to prove her suspicion is true . however , her suspicions do n't stop there , she also suspects nikki of being attracted to her husband.due to health issues , bell is limited in her investigation , so she asks her husband to continue the investigation . ignoring her doctor 's orders , she gets in too deep and must discover the deadly truth.deadly charm is the third installment of the amanda bell brown mysteries . although it would be a good idea to read the first two installments to get the full development of the characters , deadly charm can work as a stand-alone . i did n't feel any mystery in the novel because i was able to figure it out early in the story , but i remained captive to bell 's crazy antics , bell and jazz 's tug-of-love relationship , and the christian overtones.reviewed by sharon lewisof the rawsistaz ( tm ) reviewers

> as i listened to the presidential debates , the democratic contenders were making promises to protect jobs in places like ohio . hey guys , those jobs are gone . they are not coming back . i do n't want , none of us want , to pay several thousand more for an `` all american car . `` as this book points out , only an all encompassing organization , namely one that represents all of society wants to push policies that raise overall incomes rather than just that of their members at the expense of others.that 's the theme of this book . it is not concerned with the social or intellectual origins of the protest movement , it focuses on the arguments advanced by those who what to halt or reverse market-driven globalization and destroy the international institutions that promote and oversee it . these protestors fall , broadly , into two groups : old-fashioned economic interests on the one hand , and , more important today , single-issue , non-governmental organizations , often with mass memberships , on the other.born of jewish parents in england , refugees from europe , mr. wolf has , if not first hand , then close second hand , knowledge of the perils of nazi , soviet , maoist governments . then a period of time in the world bank , observing the realities of tightly controlled governments in failing countries has given him a strong agreement with churchill 's famous statement : `` democracy is the worst of all systems , except all the others that have been tried .

> wow . judas unchained ( and for that matter , pandora 's star ) are like someone fingerpainted with plot . this is the second half of a long long book which is still barely long enough to contain all the characters , references , winks , nods , fights and battle scenes . hamilton leads us from virtual worlds , to artificial intelligence , to interstellar elves , to media commentary . and all of this comes wrapped in a package of saving the universe.i loved it , i freely admit that . i could hardly put it down and stayed up way too late reading . i can , however , imagine that someone would not love it . the flaws are many and the array of characters are often confusing . i found that the overall energy of the thing was so good that i did not mind.neither judas unchained nor pandora 's star are going to be everybody 's cup of tea . but if you like your space opera big and literate , then this should appeal . if you have not read any hamilton before now , i think that the night 's dawn trilogy is a little more accessible.probably goes without saying , but if you have not read pandora 's star , do not begin with judas unchained . this is not a series as much as it is the second half of a very long book .

> this book was a fresh look at friendship and provider the reader with some great ideas for pulling people together to help them become even better.though the book was a bit more geared toward women , i will say that the author did an amazing job at building her characters up , allowing us to truly know the characters on a deep level.in today 's society there is nothing like getting friends together for food and conversation . this book takes the best of this idea and turns it into a story that you just want to continue reading . also , due to the deep character development , you are drawn into the character 's lives , and not just the story.overall , after reading this book , i can definitely see this as a book that would be great for a book club or other small group that already brings people together as this is the overall idea of the book anyway .

> reviewed by jamie driggersbeth lives among the old order mennonites , and though she shares their christian faith , she does n't share their lifestyle . while , yes , she feels that god brought her to sommerfeld , kansas , and gave her a gift as a stained-glass artist , how can she rectify the two in a place where women are homemakers and art is frivolous ? and what of men ? in her employee , andrew , beth finds a compassionate and hardworking friend , but to embrace him would be to embrace his old order lifestyle , something beth is n't inclined to do . when sean shows up at her studio door proposing a business relationship , beth begins to see the realization of her dreams . but can she trust either of these men with her future ? oh , how i love kim vogel sawyer 's books . frankly , i 'm not sure whether it is her setting ( my old stomping grounds ) or her ability to weave great stories , but i think it is a combination of the two . kim is a master storyteller who has cornered the market on a lesser known sect of mennonite , the old order . in my not-old-order opinion , she nails the people and their gentle ways from an `` outsider 's '' view point.but do n't go away with the impression that this is `` just another mennonite book , '' because it is n't . though you will see into the lives of a few characters , this book is more about feeling like an outsider in any part of life . about not being good enough , not fitting in , desiring more and , eventually , letting go of the idea that life is under our control.armchair interviews says : if this author is new to you , check her out .

> barry levinson 's `` what just happened '' belongs to the sub-genre of insider 's look at hollywood . we have seen many of them : `` sunset boulevard , '' `` the player , '' and to a lesser degree , `` tropic thunder . '' based on the memoir by producer art linson , `` what just happened '' should offer an intriguing insight into the world of film-making . well , that 's what i thought.i was wrong . not that the film is bad . it is just ordinary , keeps telling the story we have heard before . `` what just happened '' stars robert de niro as ben , a hollywood producer , whose latest film starring sean penn ( playing himself ) has received overwhelming negative responses at the test screening . in addition , he is having trouble with bruce willis ( playing himself ) refusing to shave his thick beard , and also with his second wife kelly ( robin wright penn ) . is n't this a bit too familiar ? one of the most impressive things about `` just what happened '' is its star-studded cast including stanley tucci , john turturro , kristen stewart , catherine keener , moon bloodgood and michael wincott . acting is all excellent , and there are some very funny moments , the opening sequence describing the disastrous screening test , for instance.but the entire film as a satire lacks the edge and freshness we expect from this kind of material . what is told here about hollywood stars and film making is actually nothing new to most of the viewers today . as a drama `` just what happened '' is weak and familiar . characters are stock types , flat and boring . we wait for something interesting to happen . sorry , but no such luck .
= ( 2.5 stars ) great cast and not so great satire

> while browsing at my local library i happen to stumle on this , and the curiosity factor was such that i simply had to pick this up and listen for myself to verify what i had heard left and right ( namely that this is pretty bad ) .on `` paris '' ( 11 tracks , 40 min . ) , paris hilton tries to portray herself as the new britney spears musically speaking . and why not ? with spears herself pretty muc having disappeared , maybe there is room in the market . unfortunately , hilton 's singing is so weak and flat that no amount of producing can fix that . it took some wincing to actually listen to this album from start to finish . if i can point out any highlights , i guess it 'd be the reggea-flavored `` stars are blind '' and the dance-along `` nothing in this world '' , and surely it 's not a coincidence that both those tracks were released as singles . the album closer with an absolute horrible cover of rod stewart 's classic `` do ya think i 'm sexy '' .in all , this is really as bad as has been rumored . i guess i just wanted to hear it for myself . having done that , i am now returning this to my local library , and it is safe to say that i do not feel compelled to buy this for myself .

> although i loved hillenbrand 's previous seabiscuit , when i heard about the topic of unbroken , i was wary . a story about a pow in japan ? sounds boring . worse , i lived in japan for years and was afraid this would be a hatchet job , the good and noble american against the evil japanese.i 'm happy to say my fears were unfounded , and this was possibly the best book i 've read since , well , seabiscuit . yes , his tormentor was a raging psychopath , and the japanese were n't big on helping pows survive , but hillenbrand shows the good and bad side of japanese culture in a fair and thoroughly researched account . but this book is really about louis and the personality that allowed him to survive not only the horrors of the pow camps but a record time adrift a tiny raft in shark infested waters of the south pacific . she not only made it interesting , she made it exciting.we read this for a history book club . for the first time , possibly ever , every member not only did n't dislike the book , not only did n't think it was just okay or wished it had been a bit better , but loved the book . everybody . a first.got a copy now . once you pick it up , you wo n't put it down .

> alfred hitchock never created emblematic characters . for instance , an adultery commited for the wife of the intellectual murderer is the starting point to the story .through the film runs we tend to forget that initial premise and we defend the victim . the same mechanism is used in psycho or strangers in a train .the remarkable point is interesting since it demonstrates that nobody is innocent , but less guilty .ray milland is superb as the cheated husband , he will build a complex plan to convince and ancient schoolmate who actually is not a winner , showing him a picture from his school times ( where we see once more to hitchock in this , clear , funny and very often device from the suspense master ) and persuades to him to murder his own wife .all in theory seems to work out in a perfect level , but as always the human factor appears struggling the neck to the anticipated destiny.grace kelly is extraordinary and to me , she never was best in any other hitchcock film . the movie is loaded with ironical bits and the typical english clever humor .and once the camera working around the hall in almost the eighty per cent of the film is another remarkable asp & egrave ; ct to celebrate .the close up resource is perfect . hitchock was always a master in this sense .one of my timeless favorites .

> if you follow the instructions on the back of the box , this product will not work as well as it could . the instructions say to rub the microdermabrasion treatment on clean skin and then to follow with the peel activator serum . this is all fine advice if you want a mediocre peel.the second time i tried this product a few days later i washed my face and left my skin damp and then rubbed in about a teaspoon of the microdermabrasion that i first ran under a little water . adding a little water and having your face moist seems to be key . i then added about a teaspoon of the peel activator serum and noticed that it was distributing itself far more thourally than without the additional water . the second time my skin was completely soft and there was n't a trace of dry skin . do rub the products on your face for the full time - 1 minute for each product.you may also find you enjoy this as a hand treatment . i found it exfoliates the hands very well and will leave them smoother and softer just after one treatment.for maintenance ( if you are only using the microdermabrasion once every two weeks ) i 'd recommend you useolay regenerist thermal ( warms up ) mini-peel , 6-ouncesand olay regenerist detoxifying pore scrub 6.5 fl oz ( 192 ml ) .~the rebecca review

> note : i ordered directly from amazon , not a third party seller . if you wa n't to avoid fakes , make sure you order directly from amazon.i was very excited to get this case today . so far , it is great ! ! ! ! it protects my phone insanely well , and for $ 23 it is worth every penny . the phone does not fit loose in the case as some described ( i assume they had a fake one ) . it may be a bit bulkly , but i expected that and i could care less . i 'm knocking off one star though due to a small annoyance , which is the built in screen protector . when you use it for a while , it causes a rainbow effect to show up where the screen protector is touching the glass screen ( there is a small space between the screen and the protector ) . although it is n't too big of a deal , it definitely bugs me a bit.overall , if you want to keep your iphone ( or any device for that matter ) , stick with otter box.i give it a 4/5 .
= awesome , but one small gripe
< great case for $ 23

> first in the series for me . although of course you seem to miss a few things here and there it stood well by itself for me . i really loved waverly . marie murnane seems to write from what she knows ! all of the characters are generally likeable . a bit whiny at times but likeable ! mother-in-laws are crazy themselves at times , so i really felt the tendency to side with waverly but at some point do n't you ignore people ? from the beginning to the end you wonderful if her day will really happen ! and to think this all started 2 years ago ! i loved their story , so romantic ! ! if nothing else you will love the romantic tones . and everyone needs a best friend like andie ! ! ! i hope there will be more of waverly and jake.. and more from murnane in the future ! ! ! and the title so goes with the book ! stay with it , you will get it ! i also love the cover . totally !

> there 's a rundown , drug infested neighborhood in philadelphia known as devil 's corner , where the father of assistant u.s. attorney victoria allegretti grew up . on a routine call to the hood , vicki 's partner is gunned down , and , vick being vick , she plunges into the quest to nail the perp . the very next day , the addicted mother of raheema bristow is cruelly murdered , and she reluctantly agrees to provide vicki with the street smarts necessary to navigate this jungle.as a crime/police procedural novel , devil 's corner is simplistic and , in parts , incredible . but the chemistry that develops between raheema and vicki is fun . there 's a particularly entertaining scene in which raheema can only roll her eyes over vick 's vocabulary . but vick leads raheema into some truly inane situations , and the reader has to wonder how she gets away with her impulsive , law-breaking tactics . but if you 're willing to forgo veracity , there 's some entertainment to be had in devil 's corner .

> `` we need new names '' tells the story of darling , a young girl growing up in zimbabwe during the mugabe regime . in an effort to escape the dangerous reality of her current situation , darling eventually heads for america in search of her aunt . unfortunately , the land of hope and dreams is n't at all what she expected , as her options as an african immigrant are severely limited.i very much enjoyed this brutally honest , vivid depiction of what life is like for these people who escape terrorized homelands only to be victimized in another country in a totally different way . the ending of the book was very abrupt , which i did n't like , but the rest of the book makes up for it . if you liked the book `` what is the what , '' you will enjoy this story very much .

> i 've become accustomed to compact head toothbrushes but this full headed version is easy to use . the soft bristles are of different lengths and they do a better than average job of cleaning around the gums and between teeth . the ergonomic handle is comfortable but too chunky to fit in the brush holders i have . it does provide a secure grip though . the little tongue cleaner worked and exists to remind the user not to forget that often overlooked area.colgate is one of the leading names in oral hygiene . although this brush is not my favorite , it does a better than average job of cleaning . the soft brushes will appeal to those with sensitive tenth and gums . recommended .

> the hollies were one of the best british groups around in the sixties . this anthology attempts to cater for the whole world by including songs that were hits in a variety of different countries . clearly a lot of research went into the track selection , though a third cd would have been required to do the job comprehensively . stewball ( a huge hit for peter paul and mary elsewhere ) was a huge swedish hit for the hollies but is not included here . two minor american hits ( another night , do the best you can ) are also missing , as are minor hits from some other countries.despite those omissions , this is an undeniably strong compilation . of course , their biggest successes were in their home country , where their long list of big hits includes i 'm alive , sorry suzanne , on a carousel , look through any window , the air that i breathe , carrie anne , he ai n't heavy he 's my brother , bus stop , jennifer eccles , just one look and yes i will . of these , just one look is a cover of a song that had been a huge american hit for doris troy.the big uk hits are not the only ones worth hearing . if i needed someone and king midas in reverse were , by their standards , modest hits but still wonderful . the generally less successful seventies are also well represented , not only by the air that i breathe ( first recorded a year earlier by phil everly - yes , really ) , but by long cool woman in a black dress , gasoline alley bird and boulder to birmingham ( a cover of an emmylou harris song ) . a new recording completes the set.this is as good a collection of hollies music as you are ever likely to find . if you enjoy british sixties pop music , you will find much to enjoy here .

> i 've tried this for about a month and i 've notice twice that tartar has started to build in a loose space between my teeth . after the second time , i decided to use floss just after using the water flosser . what i found were some big globs of plaque/tarter between some of the back teeth . i do n't know where waterpik gets their statistics , but so far , i am very disappointed . i thought this was supposed to be easier to use and more effective than floss . that 's not what 1 month of experience tells me.the manual is typical of modern waterpik appliances ( i 've tried their electric toothbrush too ) . it is nice to look at , but does n't tell you much useful information . for instance:1. it does n't tell you that the effectiveness of the flosser is severely diminished if you use less than medium pressure . you can only get this information by look online at waterpik 's site for professionals.2 . it also does n't tell you that you can only use the flosser for 5 minutes within any 2 hour period . otherwise , you risk overheating the motor and reducing its life . if everyone flosses at night , you 'd need one of these for everyone ( so wasteful ) . you can only get this information if you look at the sticker found at the bottom of the appliance . somehow , i do n't think many people will every look there . i did it only by chance.i think people who do n't floss are more likely to use this product since it takes such little time and makes my mouth feel clean , but it is not more effective than regular floss . also this product works well to clean metal work in the mouth such as braces or wires on your teeth .

> ` prince of persia ' is one of those films that seems like it should be really good , but after viewing it leaves you feeling rather deflated and disappointed . most elements seem to be there , stunning set pieces , a reasonable story premise ( although the plot execution let it down ) , beautiful costumes , impressive parkour style stunts and big budget effects and yet it gets sorely let down in other areas . the story gets so ridiculous in places that it is a film you need to suspend disbelief to truly enjoy it and the acting is pretty wooden from all involved . this is especially disappointing from gyllenhaal who has acted well in past films and from molina who acts like a character from pirates of the caribbean , with the most ludicrous accent for a man who lives in the middle east ( it 's more east end ! ) . towards the end this turns into a weak indiana jones wannabe , with a temple of doom and booby traps , but it can never compete . there is also meant to be a romance between gyllenhaal and arterton but rarely have i seen such a lack of chemistry between two actors . these aspects , along with the poor plot execution make this a chore to watch and hard to fully enjoy . it is one of those films you will have been glad to have not wasted money on seeing at the cinema and it is only worth buying if you can pick it up very cheap . you will watch it once and probably never again . shame , it could have delivered so much more.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> the long awaited fourth film by quentin tarantino is very , very far from being anything close to a disappointment . tarantino really risked a lot while crafting this homage to japanese grindhouse cinema , beginning with the opening & quot ; shaw-scope & quot ; logo to the buckets of blood splattered throughout the film , but it all pays off from beginning to end . when the bride ( uma thurman , perfectly cast ) awakens from a four year coma , she sets out for revenge against bill ( an unseen david carradine ) and his deadly viper assassination squad ( consisting of lucy liu , vivica fox , darryl hannah , and michael madsen ) ; all of whom left her for dead on her wedding day . like tarantino 's pulp fiction , kill bill vol . 1 is presented out of order before it finally comes full circle ; another risk tarantino has taken that , just like in that film , pays off brilliantly . the action scenes are better than anything you 'll see in any movie with the word matrix in it 's title , but do be warned , this is not for the squeamish . miramax played a large role in tarantino cutting the film in half , but with volume 2 right around the corner , we 'll see how the bloody saga of the bride concludes . the features on the dvd are basically fluff , i 'd recommend waiting until vol . 2 is released on dvd which will no doubt be packaged with vol . 1 and containing a host of features .

> this basic , common sense , practical and down-to-earth guide to leadership will delight anyone who has always wondered how to become a leader but never figured out how . steve farber , author of this treasury of leadership lore , is the leader who can help you find the leader within you . his parable is full of the kind of characters who delight storytellers , such as the affectionately-limned 22-year-old blonde in a bikini who approaches the author on a beach to ask what he thinks leadership is , or the zen-like old , grizzled sage of leadership . these characters are designed to inspire you to believe that you , too , can be a leader , no matter how low your self-esteem . moreover , farber pushes business writing to the edge ( in fact , one of his main characters is named edg ) . he even manages to work in quotations from decadent , drunken , insane poet charles bukowski , author of such classics as notes of a dirty old man . read this book and learn to follow the leader to leadership . it turns out that leadership is surprisingly easy once you know how to do it . we believe we are not giving away too much of the ending if we tell you that the author believes `` love '' is the final answer to the question , `` what is leadership ? ''

> immortalis carpe noctern by katie salidasafter being attacked on the unlv and nearly raped and killed by her attackers , alyssa is aided by lysander ( a vampire of course ! ) and subsequently turned into one herself . this story deals with alyssa and her learning what her new life is like as fledgling vampire , and dealing with her somewhat reluctant sire.this is not our typical vampire tale . at least not like the more modern fare we see flooding the genre lately . they do drink blood ( a lot of it ) and instead of the whitewashed tales we are being fed lately , they do kill when they feed.if you like sherrilyn kenyon 's take on the mythology of vampires or the extremely heavy angst that authors such as christine feehan gives us ; you will most likely enjoy immortalis carpe noctern . ms. salidas takes great care to teach us her take on vampire mythology and set up a rather bleak world for lysander and alyssa . if you like lighter , happier , sexier fare , when the vamps are the dark , sexy , brooding ` good ' guy , this most likely will not be for you.i believe that this writer will mature and grow into her writing quite soon and needs to be an author to watch .

> this is a great humidifier . if you do n't care about animal shapes , then you 're better off with this one . i do n't care for wicking design humidifiers . i use the cool mist ones , and of the ones i 've owned , these crane 's are the best . crane 's teardrop design is better then the animal designs , hands , down , and i get the impression one of their designers said 'hey , that looks like a penguin , maybe we should make one like that . ' we replaced an elephant one ( which dripped ) with the penguin one , and the penguin is the next best thing to the original . but then i guess somebody said , 'hey , this penguin is cool , let 's make a whole bunch of other designs . ' which is probably where things went wrong . stick with the teardrop and the penguin and you 'll be fine . i also only use distilled water , and these work sooo well with it ... the tank and basin are always clean , even after sitting for a while , and there is never any residue on things in the room from whatever garbage is in the water / mist .

> i read niceville and thought it was brilliant . so i was glad to see a follow up . if anything , i think this one is better.even though i had read niceville , i struggled a little at the beginning . you get introduced to so many characters in such short order that it is a little hard to keep track of . but once i got into the rhythm i was fine.stroud can write . it is n't overblown purple prose . it is straight forward and hilarious . it was fitting the there was an elmore leonard quote calling for a follow up to niceville since leonard is the closest thing to stroud . stroud does such a great job with language that when he starts to introduce slightly wackier things they seem very practical and realistic . this story could have really faltered in a lesser writers hands.you will never look at a flock of crows the same way . i am excited for the next one .

> my view of this product is fairly simple : it works , but it might be priced higher than its quality . i got it for my husband , who loves the convenience of shaving in the shower . i hoped for a more durable piece , but this is standard plastic with a less-than-impressive mirror.the good : my husband actually likes what makes this anti-fog ( removing the mirror and filling up a tank on the back ) and finds it easy enough to do . the mirror comes with the option for suction cups or stickers.the bad : i just ca n't fathom paying so much for this ! it 's a nice little gadget , but its simplicity is not worth the price . the mirror does n't fog , but it 's not the greatest mirror and the light only offers so much . we are in constant fear of it breaking .

> what this movie needed was thirty less minutes not twenty more . what film stock could peter jackson have swept up the editing room floor ? maybe bilbo washing dishes after the dwarves ate . i dunno . i sat thru the entire spectacle in december and there was so much going on at too fast a pace with that crystal clear 60fps and in 3d that i ca n't really remember too much of what happened . but thats what happens when the movie takes longer than the avg reader takes to read the book . ima gon na go out on an ent limb and posit that tho tolkein wouldve been slightly amused and equally aghast at jackson et al 's lotr trilogy this go around the master would be just perplexed and bewildered . he 'd recognize some of what is on the screen but not nearly enough . the one seminal moment in this particular installment was bilbo and that gollum fellow scene . movie magic . otherwise ima gon na suggest that jackson has bloated this tale cause he really doesnt know what to do with himself on other movies . king kong was fascinating but if im watching any king kong movie again its the original and thats it . and the lovely bones was the bomb that it was . personally if jackson did more tin tin flicks i 'd be thrilled but the rest of humanity missed the boat on the greatness of that flick . but as i said at the end of hobbit one to all the fellow theatre goers , & # 34 ; we are three hours down , six more to go . see you all next year. & # 34 ; sorry for any typoes but this ipad gizmo is tough on me eyes .

> in my many years as a fan of horror films , few have ever actually been even the slightest bit scary . signs is not only scary , it is scary in the second or third watching.signs is two stories seamlessly sewn into one . at the heart we have mel gibson as a single father . he had been a man of the cloth until the death of his wife . now he is trying to raise his children with the help of his younger brother.in the larger picture , the world is undergoing some amazing events . we experience them through gibson 's family . like an anton checkov play , most of the action is off screen and thus scarier.as gibson is trying to hold his family together , something happens in his corn field . cornstalks are bent in strange symbols . rustling , shadows and strange noises are used to great effect that literally raised the hair on the back of my neck.gibson faces family and world events while trying to come to terms with his shaken faith . faith is at the heart of this movie and gibson 's portrayal is brilliant.pay attention to the details . everything seems to have a purpose . even watch it a second time as casual remarks in the beginning take on new meaning once you know more of past events ( i.e . gibson 's insistence at using a people doctor when the dog gets sick ) .in many ways i find this movie superior to the sixth sense even though the later was more favored by the media . but both show seamless storytelling and great attention to detail . if you enjoyed one , you should enjoy the other . while you are at it , check out unbreakable .

> i 've long been a fan of sandisk . from mp3 players to flash drives , i trust the name and the quality of the product . thus when i needed a bigger flash drive i had no qualms about buying sandisk 's cruzer . unfortunately , i should have purchased it at amazon for i could have got the 32gb cruzer for a tad more than the 8gb unit i bought at target . but i was in a hurry and , well , enough about that.the 8gb cruzer meets my needs so i ca n't complain about performance . write times matter little to me , i 'm looking for portability for my data . what i am disappointed in is the nearly impossible clip attachment method . sandisk does not include a nylon strap so i was left to my own devices . i tried wire but that did n't really work . i next tried key chains , but they were too big . finally , i took the small key chain loop from a mini pocket knife and that at least allowed me to then run a bigger keychain loop so i can carry this with far more confidence than without any kind of connection.sandisk could provide a nylon loop or some other means of connecting a carry chain . people do not want to risk losing their device and a neckchain or other clip would add security to the user.as i said , the performance of the 8gb cruzer meets all of my needs , a bit more consideration for transporting the device would be a welcome improvement .

> i have been using this product for several years . it has dramatically improved my oral hygiene , and has directly resulted in improved results at the dentist.i do n't doubt that a disciplined and skilled brusher could do just as good a job with a traditional toothbrush , but for me , i found this brush to be a big help.the only downside of this toothbrush is the cost of the replacement heads . they say to replace the heads every three months , which is about right for a lot of people . i find mine needing replacement about once a month . i do n't know if that is because i brush harder or longer than average , but whatever the cause they are definitely worn out after a month of use . you can expect to replace to replace yours between every one and three months . that alone is n't bad , but the problem is that the best price you can find for the replacement heads is about $ 10 each . more often they are about $ 15 . $ 120 - $ 180 per year is a lot of money to spend on brush heads.compared to more featured and more expensive brushes , i would recommend the one on this page , the essence . `` massage '' , `` sensitive '' , and `` clean '' modes are not really needed and certainly not worth paying so much extra for . the tapered start , two minute timer , and long battery life of this brush is all the features that are needed .
= great product . i just wish the replacement heads were n't so expensive .

> `` the name of the rose '' is a smart , very european mystery combining chunks of theological controversy , history , mystery and a good lashing of humor thrown in . eco is a very clever writer ; he can combine these seemingly incompatible elements and make a book that 's hard to put down.i certainly could n't put it down as i followed brother adso , the monk who narrates the story . when a novice in a monastery in 1327 , adso accompanied the brilliant william of baskerville on an investigation into mysterious deaths amongst the monks . each death is more and more bizarre ; the method of murder perplexing . the key to the murders is locked in the labyrinthine passages of the monastery , incredibly well-described by eco . the library , in particular , is fraught with dangers . the descriptions are so vivid that i can close my eyes and picture the scenes in the bath , the kitchens and the library with great detail . eco is masterful in creating visual richness.the novel is larded with latin phrases , theological and literary arguments which may annoy readers who have not included these weighty subjects in their education . no matter , you can read this mystery and enjoy the clever revelation of clues and solution . eco does play on `` sherlock holmes '' with `` baskerville '' as a clue to the mental prowess of sir william . if you like a good mystery and historical fiction , it does n't get a lot better than `` name of the rose .

> this knitting book is ground-breaking . instead of following a pattern line by line ( nothing wrong with that , i like to do that ) you learn how to create sweaters to fit any body , with any yarn . why would anyone want to do that ? well , you might have bought 15 balls of yarn on sale and do n't know what to make of it . instead of waiting for a pattern to turn up for that amount of yarn , that weight , etc , you can create your own sweater in various styles to fit anyone , you , a family member or friend.the percentage system used in this book is easy to follow : knit a sample of your yarn , carefully measure how many stitches per inch or centimeter , then multiply that gauge times your chest circumference minus 10 percent for the ribbing . increase up to 100 percent and off you go . soon you will have a yoke style sweater , norwegian drop shoulder or saddle shoulder , or even raglan style . such freedom . you can go to yarn sales and as long as you have enough yarn , you can make anything from it.right now i am knitting a cotton summer top using this method with some bargain yarn . while this book does n't have gorgeous color photographs of stylish knits , it does teach you to create your own . after i bought this book , my knitting really took off . yours might , too .

> i like to keep music playing throughout the night . sometimes i enjoy listening to audio books or watching videos in be without disturbing she who is saintly and kind and wonderful . i prefer laying on my side and traditional headphones do n't work out well.this acoustic sheep unit is the answer . i measured my head and followed the company 's suggestion of ordering the extra large size and fits very nicely . not too loose , not too snug . i literally forget i 'm wearing it within seconds.the earpieces are thin and flat . it takes a little adjustment to get them properly placed over my ears.volume and audio quality are more than adequate . i doubt audiophiles will find them satisfactory , but i find the audio quality to be more than useful.i sleep soundly with them on and really enjoy the fredom of hearing my music over the various fans and street noise.in short , i love them.i do have concerns , though . the cable seems flimsy - and it is , in my opinion , too short . i added an extension cable immediately so i did n't have to keep my audio device under the pillow or worry about it being pulled off the night table . overall , i suspect the cable - and thus the unit - will not have a long life . so i consider this to be disposable device.but the benefits it provides are worth the price , if need be , of replacing it annually or so.jerry

> for me , one great advantage this film had over its predecessor was that i could see everything that was going on . none of those major conflicts in the dark . on the other hand , lacking this time was the female buddy aspects which were a major part of the drama in the first picture . over-all , there was much more blood with less reason than before but just as much in the way of disgusting scenes to satisfy the broad public which enjoys that sort of thing . there really was no way for any performer to do a good acting job ... or a really bad one , given the limited range of emotion allowed . they all seemed to be up to what was asked of them . hands down , the sheriff in the piece , wins the keystone kop award for most ludicrous , in this case inadvertent , stupidity in a law officer for the recent decade . no fault of the actor , it was written that way.in sum , not much else to say without revealing plot , this should satisfy those who identify horror with nauseous behavior and display . it should have absolutely nothing to offer the average viewer who likes popcorn with their movie watching , or a tray of food if at home . for myself , i wo n't bother looking to see if there is yet another descent coming . two is more than enough .

> starting and finishing with 2 of their most bluntly beautiful compositions in their catalouge , radiohead does not waste a second to prove to the masses what we would all eventually come to realize some 5 , 10 years later ... the quality of composition stays consistent throughout , and while not as emotionally engaging or experimental as some of their later work , the majority of the album feels like a proper introduction to the true roots of one of our generations most brilliant bands , the pablo honey they were destined to make at first , had they taken a little more time..if you find yourself being turned off by this band 's overindulgences as of late , you might want to start with this album , where all of the artistic `` fat '' that is associated with the melancholic beauty this band has come to provide is boiled down into it 's most accessable common rock essence..radiohead would go on to blaze a trail not seen throughout modern rock 's history , however they would never repeat , perhaps intentionally , the accessability mixed with quality again as they had with the bends ... .in a way , it is the last `` non self conscious '' album they were to put out..enjoy what they sounded like before they grew paranoid in their compositions as the entire world watched ...

> i do n't know what i can add that other reviewers have n't already touched upon . this is a book about jeffrey sachs and his millennium villages projects . so this is just a vote , rather than an in depth review.i found the book interesting and compelling , but a little painful to read at time . the writing is solid but i found myself wanting to argue with the author on more than one occasion . in general , this book left me with a far greater understanding of the topic of poverty in our world than i ever had.i recommend the book semi-enthusiastically .

> set in the year 2028 , the rebooted & # 8220 ; robocop & # 8221 ; starts out with a detroit police officer and family man alex murphy ( joel kinnaman ) fatally wounded by a car bomb . alex is saved by omnicorp & # 8217 ; s cutting-edge technology and reborn as & # 8220 ; robocop , & # 8221 ; but omnicorp & # 8217 ; s ceo raymond sellars ( michael keaton ) has his own agenda for offering a help.one significant difference from the original is that nearly dead alex or robocop wakes up as a human with emotions . the change could have made for a more emotional drama between the protagonist and his wife clara ( abbie cornish ) and son & # 8211 ; and a genius scientist dr. dennett norton played by gary oldman & # 8211 ; but director jos & eacute ; padilha , known for brazilian drama & # 8220 ; elite squad , & # 8221 ; misses the chance , with clara & # 8217 ; s character that is disappointingly bland.like the remake ( or re-imagined ) version of & # 8220 ; total recall , & # 8221 ; the new & # 8220 ; robocop & # 8221 ; is much less violent than the original directed by paul verhoeven . that itself is not a big problem , but the lack of biting satires and memorable one-liners is something different . watching samuel l. jackson as political tv show host is not bad , but his wordy section is too long.action is slick , but generic . the cast is impressive , including marianne jean-baptiste , jennifer ehle and jackie earle haley , but none of their characters is given enough screen time to develop . photography is fine and gadgets are interesting , but not good enough to make the project , especially its weaker second part , very entertaining .

> i was n't sure about this . i wanted a case that could hold a card , but did n't want a closed cover , i was thinking more something with a niche in the back . however my son ordered this for me and i thought i would give it ago.i just love it . i now leave the house with only this and my keys , and i have everything i need . the cover feels very protective and the magnetic snap is both secure but also very easy to remove and open , and it will snap the cover back , if you are using the phone for some time and want it out of the way . i love the color , a warm tomato red , and especially the texture , it feels like a really soft expensive leather.the cons : 1 ) the holder is super thin . it holds one credit card easily , but two is definitely full , and it makes the cover heavier and less balanced . 2 ) it affects the photographing . if i took zillions of photos this case would not work for me . you ca n't fold it back when photographing , because it covers the lens , so it has to kind of dangle in an annoying way . i do n't take too many photos but it still annoys me . 3 ) and finally i 'm not sure how sturdy it 's going to be . there was already a small tear in the fine leather on the closing strap.but i still love it and rate it a happy find . it 's liberated me from my wallet .

> this is really just the perfect , simple gift . if you drink health or protein shakes all the time , it 's perfect . if you want to make homemade dressing , it 's perfect . if you want to make a light batter for whatever , it 's perfect . beat eggs ? perfect ! sure , you 'll get a bit of an arm workout , but that should be a plus for everyone unless you 're injured.i originally bought them as gifts for the men in my family ( they love it for their protein shakes ) and it 's funny now how my mom and i are attracted to these for simple home/marinade use . the bottles are bpa-free and dishwasher-safe , of course , and the quality of this `` plastic '' is top calibre . washing it right after usage is ideal so things do n't stick , especially to the whipping ball.i got both the 20 ounce and 28-ounce sizes for myself for everyday use . i find the larger one ideal for marinades and batters ; the smaller one ideal for everyday eggs and fresh vinaigrettes and dressings ... the lid screws on tight and the cap pops into place very securely . i bought five from the get-go and there were no defects ; all were consistent in quality . will definitely purchase more just to give out as gifts !

> sentenced to life without parole in the hellish prison known as furnace , alex has come to know the horrors the prison holds - the black suits with their shark-like grins , the wheezers and their gas masks , the dull red wash of the bloodwatch light.however , alex attempted the impossible . he tried to escape.in this sequel to lockdown , alex 's jump for freedom into the raging underground river takes him to a new gallery of terrors.alex must face the dark hole - solitary confinement - for his breach of the prison 's security . left alone in the pitch black , cut off from human interaction , alex is left vulnerable to furnace 's tormentors , including the `` rats , '' a group of former furnace inmates who are closer to animal than human . they , though , give alex a clue as to what is really going on in furnace . where do the wheezers take the inmates they choose during the bloodwatch ? this book is a strong sophomore effort for gordon 's escape from furnace series . the descriptive language the author uses gives the reader a full-color picture of what 's happening every step of the way , which is very important for an action series like this.reviewed by : hayes aka haute librarian

> harper connelly was struck by lightning when she was 15 , and since then she has a gift , or maybe a curse -- the ability to see a corpse 's last few moments before death . since then she 's tried to make a living off this ability , travelling from job to job in the company of her step-brother tolliver.in this outing harper and tolliver are in doraville to help a woman try and find her grandson , one of several missing boys . the challenge to the author is to keep the duo in a place and situation even though harper 's gift is emphatically instantaneous , and so far harris has done a good job . this story is particularly compelling as harper deals with her first serial killer . also , the awkwardness that 's been growing around her relationship with her stepbrother finally comes to a head . there are some heart-wrenching moments in this book , and i really enjoyed the story and the characters.in the past i 've found harper to be rather humorless and too earnest to be likable , but it seems that with each book she thaws a little , and i enjoy each one more . looking forward to the next in this intriguing series .

> i 've loved these since i first saw them on television decades ago- brett delivers , without a doubt , the truest , and most accurate picture of holmes at conan doyle wrote him . brett 's holmes is detached from humanity- uninterested in other peopel , except insofar as they can provide him with an intellectual challaneg . for him , the case is the thing ; if he solves a mystery , he considers himself to have succeeded- even if the client happens to die along the way.the people and places depicted in this series may not be terribly true to history , but they are very true to conan doyle 's depiction of the age , and thus very satisfying to any serious holmsian . the rigid societal roles , the predictable behavior , the overdone stereotypes- this is the world of sherlock holmes , where all can be induced from a few clues , where invalids take to divans and fan themselves , and where the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime . if you 're holmes fan- and you must be , to have read this far- you 'll absolultley love this series .

> i 've been using these blender bottles for years . they are great for doing a whole host of things but the main use for me is that i blend up a green smoothie at night and put it in the blender bottle in the fridge . then , in the morning , i grab the pre-made smoothie and just shake it up a little with the blender bottle . i then refill with water all day at work for water consumption . i also use this for protein shakes pre and post gym . they work great for this purpose.pros : -cheap , wait for amazon to have a deal on a color and you can get them at a great price-blends well-comes in various colorscons : -gets destroyed quickly if you use the dishwasher-can retain smells if not washed quickly after usebottom line : essential tool that i will continue to purchase . could be more durable , but obviously this would up the price.pro tip : rinse with water as soon as you are done using it . the sooner the better . shake that water up in there with a little soap and rinse .

> i like all kinds of genres , and this book brought out the best in a lot of them . it is definitely an adult novel with all the sex , violence , and swearing . i think they did n't overabuse any of those three , however , and the book was written quite well . there does n't seem to be too many sarcastic remarks lost in the translation ; it all flows very well and the characters become very likeable . i 'm not sure if that is the work of the original author or of the translator but either way this book is humorous an becomes more and more action-packed towards the end . i highly recommend this book - also i am halfway through the second in the series and that one is even better than this so far , so if you are intimidated by a trilogy i encourage you to read on because they are definitely worth taking the time to read .

> the panasonic lumix dmc-fz20k 5mp digital camera looks and almost acts like a 35mm digital slr , but with two major differences . first , it is much smaller than a full-fledged 35mm digital slr from the likes of nikon , canon or minolta . but more importantly , it has an image-stabilized non-interchangeable leica vario-elmarit zoom lens which is undoubtedly one of the finest lenses available in digital photography . i have become quite a fan of panasonic 's lumix line of digital cameras , and this camera is yet another excellent representative . i 'm quite impressed with the optical excellence demonstrated by the leica lens , though frankly i am not surprised , since i rely extensively on leica optics in my leica m rangefinder camera kit . if you are someone seeking the best optical performance possible from a 5mp digital camera , then you surely wo n't go wrong acquiring this panasonic lumix camera .

> when last year i saw the poster for this then yet-to-released movie at my local independent movie theatre , i was thrilled and really could n't wait to see this , since i was such a fan of the book upon which this isbased . then for whatver reason the movie never came to the theatres here in cincinnati , so i recently checked out the dvd . `` freakonomics '' ( 93 min . ) tries to bring onto the screen pretty much the same stories that the co-authors brought us in the book . most of the stories as brought in the movie actually are condensed and gloss over a lot of the details , in particular the data supporting the seemingly unexpected results from the `` hidden side of everything '' . that proves to be a fatal flaw for the movie , even if the movie is not bad as entertainment . the one section that goes further than what is in the book is the sumo wrestling investigation to explore corruption , and that was foor me the best part of the movie . in all , it 's not a bad movie , and certainly compared to the crap of most hollywood mainstream commercial movies , this is a standout movie.every single reviewer of this movie falls into 1 of 2 categories : either as having read the book before seeing the movie , or as not having read the book . i can almost guarantee that very few of us who have read the book , will be entralled with the movie . if you happen to not have read the book or seen the movie yet , i 'd suggest you save your money on this dvd and instead head on over to amazon 's books section and buy freakconomics and its sequel superfreakonomics .

> `` adventureland '' is about summer jobs and finding your way in today 's world . the recent economic downturn is featured in family cut-backs and youth downsizing their dreams . the main character is james brennan ( jesse eisenberg ) who is somewhat shocked and disappointed when his father loses his job . he had plans to go on a european vacation he dreamed of , and also plans to move to new york and go to a good college and make something of his life . he has to take a poorly paying summer job at a local amusement park . the movie has character studies of the amusement park workers and the dynamics . they all share the same dopey job , wearing special t-shirts ( `` games '' or `` rides '' ) . there are some laughs in the dead-end jobs , and actually some preparation excercises for the real world . the future of these kids did not seem that great , and a sad feeling came over me as i realized how many college-educated kids are out there looking for scarce well-paying jobs . these kids just got high on weed or denial about futures . the film is upbeat , but an underlying dread permeates this comedy/drama . boredom and no good-paying job opportunities are there for them and their parents . the kids are touching and a bit of hope and love comes through at the end , but i look at the current financial mess the country is in and feel sorry for the characters . `` adventureland '' is a film focused on youth , and made for them . it is also an interesting peek into the changing times and the 21st century youth culture for the empathetic older viewer .

> this is an interesting book that tells what is known about benjamin franklin 's sister . much of any personal paperwork she had is missing and much is inferred from reading franklin 's letters which were saved . she , like most women of the period was not educated to write , only to read and only then what was suitable material.jill lepore uses the original spelling which adds a depth of knowledge as we read what does exist of jane 's letters and a ` book ' she made to list the family births and deaths.what a reader should be aware of is that 171 pages of this 438 page book are notes and appendixes . also there is a preponderance of descriptions of what life was like for women and the poor during this age and moreover there is a lot of information on franklin and the historical events that surrounded both jane and him . the story is interesting , but the title might lead some to think that most of the book is about jane franklin herself.this is a most remarkable story about a little known woman , surrounded by history . she raised her family and took in other family members . she had a hard life , especially compared to the wealth and status that benjamin had raised himself to after his poverty stricken beginnings . their affection and family ties are well documented and make this a personal look into the years before , during and after the american revolution .

'' pushing me aside for privacy , she proceeded to ` willingly ' straighten her very curly hair - it took about an hour . here is what we established . she liked the feel of the infiniti as it was light and felt powerful ( even when she dropped in on the floor and it kept running ) . she only used the ` comb accessory ' but it was strong enough and stayed on the dryer much more firmly than other attachments . ( her other stuff slips off more easily ) . the process took less time than normal and she did n't feel like she needed excessive conditioner as it was n't ' too hot . she did remark that the cord could have been a bit longer . she actually liked the results enough to make her want to keep her very curly hair straighter longer . then she asked me , `` so , do i need to come over here every time i want to straighten my hair ?

> i have a very soft spot in my heart for this great album ; it was the first van morrison album that i ever bought or heard in its entirety . this was back around 1975 , if i remember correctly , and i bought my copy on 8-track tape at a chain store ! dated format or not , the music itself has stood the test of time and still sounds fresh and captivating . indeed , there is some undefinable magical radiance at play on this album -- - and yes , you could say that about a lot of van morrison albums -- - that really strikes me.i originally bought this album for the hit singles -- - & # 34 ; jackie wilson said ( i 'm in heaven when you smile ) & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; gypsy & # 34 ; -- - but i soon found myself liking the other tracks too , especially enraptured by the longer , more atmospheric pieces such as & # 34 ; listen to the lion. & # 34 ; in retrospect , this was n't van 's very best album , yet it remains one of my very favorites . long live celtic soul !

> to be honest , i do n't see any difference between the & # 34 ; apple & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; not apple & # 34 ; ports . i have not measured them but all of our products charge on either one . perhaps they charge slower on the na port , i really have n't tested it but all devices seem to charge relatively quick on either one . i would assume some newer apple products would fail to charge on the na port , but that is not the case.i 've had this charger a while now and it 's still going , which is more or less the measurement of quality for a usb charger since the crap ones can be had for a buck . well , that and whether or not they set fire . so far , so good .

> brautigan 's life ended , at his own hand , in 1984 , but his memory lingers on . he has become known as the mark twain of the 60s , the new thoreau , and the zen trickster . his voice , ebullient , sad , and comic , is pure american . brautigan 's writing straddles the line between prose and poetry as he follows a guy named ( trust me here ) trout fishing in america across his native land in search of zen enlightenment . the ` chapters ' are anecdotes that read as fables and continue to delight after multiple re-readings . if you missed this book the first time around , perhaps because you were into other stuff during the 60s , now 's your chance .

> i have a 2003 toyota camry , and this fits fine . however , i was in a hurry to replace mine because it never had been replaced , the airflow seemed relatively weak , and its hot outside ( 110 f in phoenix ) . so , got it at local auto parts store w/o waiting for or paying for shipping , but i had to pay nearly double the price . the filter i removed was totally black , with a number of twigs and leaves thrown in on top . the next day came the true test - would it impact a/c output ? it did ! colder and more volume ! moral of the story - plan ahead and change your car 's a/c/ filter .

> amore is unique in andrea bocelli 's catalog for its laid-back ambience , a mood that he has not worked in before . the selections on this new offering are romantic , melodic , and sometimes very hot ! he is clearly at home in french and spanish as well as italian , and his english is coming along also . it 's refreshing to listen to performances in which andrea is not pushing his voice but simply embracing the lovely music . the orchestration is understated but first class , and his collaboration with such greats as stevie wonder and mario reyes lends an additional element of interest .

> sam raimi is the man . spider-man surpassed just about everyone 's predictions and is the biggest hit of the year ( 2002 ) so far ( harry potter and the two towers may knock spidey off , though ) . however , raimi always was the man . he , rob tapert , and bruce campbell parlayed their little independent film ( evil dead ) into a great franchise and used it to start their careers.crimewave was the first major feature for all involved after evil dead . the film was written by raimi and two other quirky directors , the coen brothers . the movie was largely filmed in detroit and the lead character was originally written specifically for bruce campbell ( you can just picture how much better the movie would have been with campbell in the lead role instead of the no name they cast instead ) . however , that was before tinsletown took over . campbell was scrapped as the lead , but raimi kept him on in a supporting role . a new beginning and ending was filmed because `` audiences just wo n't get it otherwise '' and raimi and company lost some editing control over the final product . the film was also plagued by all sorts of conflicts and from what i 've gathered was n't the most pleasant of shoots.the end result is crimewave , a quirky little dark comedy that if left alone would have been much better . the movie itself is full of humor on a variety of levels . the direction is intriguing and the acting is campy . the film would probably be pg by todays standards and only contains a handful of `` foul '' language and largely `` cartoon '' violence.if you are a fan of raimi , the coens , or campbell , this film is a must see . also , if you like dark comedies full of slapstick humor you will probably enjoy it .

> ` a mighty heart ' tells the story of daniel pearl who was kidnapped in pakistan in 2002 and is based on the memoirs of his wife , mariane . this film starts off by being quiet flat and without tension and whilst the story is interesting , i did n't find myself completely engaged with it . that is until the last twenty minutes which are suffused with real , raw emotion and jolie manages to show the dam bursting in mariane with power and intensity . for the duration of the ordeal mariane managed to keep calm and almost detached from the pain she was suffering as she tried to find her husband and yet at the end she releases it all in a painful rush that ca n't fail to affect you . there is minimal soundtrack to this film which gives it a pared back feel , but also did n't heighten any scenes of tension or upset . this is interesting to see the politics behind the kidnapping and how various government agencies worked together to try to find daniel and is especially insightful as it is based on true events . jolie turns out a good performance , as do the supporting cast and the direction is authentic and gritty ( some scenes are shot in locations daniel actually visited ) . if you are aware of the back story then this may have more impact and as long as you do n't expect a huge hollywood blockbuster , but a more low key political drama , then you should enjoy this just fine . this is very good , but not truly great.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> bam ! at 88 % through the story , shit hit the fan . i thought to myself `` self - no way ! i 'm sure this was a fake out - do n't worry ! '' ... . but let 's go back a moment.i put this release date on my calendar , and patiently waited . i was generally entertained as i read through divergent and insurgent , and enjoyed the story line and characters . i started reading this book the evening it was released and made it half way through in one sitting . i was hoping for an ending that would tie everything together in a nice tidy bundle . wrong ! i continued through the second half of the book the next day , cruising through the plot , until bam ! at 88 % through the story , shit hit the fan . i thought to myself `` self - no way ! i 'm sure this was a fake out - do n't worry ! things will work out . '' wrong ! the author hurt my feelings and most definitely did not meet my expectations with this book . the book quickly fizzled out , in my opinion , after ... that thing happened.i will not read any other books by this author , because i feel she has taken advantage of an audience that was fascinated by the relationships between the characters , and their place in their divergent world.4 thumbs down . from me , and from my husband who will hear me bitch about it for another week or so .

> i recently purchased this modem because i did n't want to pay rental fee to comcast for their modem . this is a much better modem than the one comcast gave me . i have been using it for 2 months now and i never lost a connection or experiened a drop in my speed . the only thing i would caution is this : when i replaced comcast modem with this one , i had to call comcast and give them information about the modem so that they could add it to their network ( if you do n't do that , then it wo n't work ) . the problem was comcast agent kept asking me for a number on the bottom of the unit , some kind of `` customer s/n '' number . i could n't find it so i gave them all the numbers . it would n't work . then i spoke with another agent who asked for the same number and suggested that it may be on the box . and there it was ! the customer s/n number that comcast needed was printed on the bottom of box ( and not on the unit ) . my advice is for you to keep the numbers on the bottom of the box ( and for motorola to start printing all the necessary number on the unit ) .

> el corazon once again gives us the steve earle we want to hear ; the fearless poet of love and beliefs that refuses to back off just because someone might be offended.i did n't even like `` christmas in washington '' a little too slow and preachy for me , but i hold earle in high esteem because he will even make the attempt to bring politics back into music . `` taneytown '' with its dark story of racism , the pain felt in the vocal of `` if you fall , '' and the regular guy on `` telephone road & lt ; '' these are the earle tunes that show him at his best.i even do n't mind when earle goes totally country ( `` i still carry you around '' `` the other side of town '' ) because he does it so well . why was n't `` nyc '' a hit ? as good a rocker as he 's ever done . in this world of compromise , earle does n't cater to anyone ; he just is what he is . he says it best on `` here i am , '' a rocking anthem : with a song in my heartand an attitude from the starti took everybody apartto see how they workand i , for one , am glad .

> the new vx-3000 is one of the best webcams i 've used . i considered the $ 99 vx-6000 , too , but decided it was too expensive for my needs . the best thing with the vx-3000 , compared to logitech and creative models , is it does *not* install tons of hidden drivers , hidden dlls , and hidden spyware ; the logitech and creative installation utilities place tons of hidden stuff on your hard drive . the vx-3000 's was a very clean installation.i use windows live messenger ( aka msn messenger 9.0 ) so i get seamless integration , although i 've seen people use it painlessly with skype . it has the best webcam image quality i 've seen . windows live messenger has been rated by various pc magazines to be the best video chat client software , and i always had good results with creative and logitech cameras in the past ( using msn messenger , which has been rebranded as windows live messenger , or wlm ) . the vx-3000 bests them all in terms of ease of use and video quality . the built-in mic is also lightyears ahead of the yesteryear models.in short , this is a great webcam that wo n't disappoint you ( unless you are a fanatical anti-american or anti-microsoftie . )

> an industrial spy ( leonardo dicaprio ) who can enter dreams to steal ideas leads a team ( joseph gordon-leavitt , ellen page , tom hardy , ken watanabe , and dileep rao ) into the mind of a young billionaire ( cillian murphy ) to introduce one instead . this involves a mind-bending scheme that involves dreams within dreams and requires the participants to risk spending a subjective eternity in the limbo of the subconscious.i 'm looking forward to christopher nolan 's next batman movie , but after this film , i kind of wish he was n't wedded to that franchise and was instead free to create his next movie out of whole cloth . he is one of the most impressive visionaries working in film today . here , he takes the familiar trope of the hardened professional willing to risk everything on one last job that will allow him to begin his life anew , and uses it as the foundation for an innovative story that does n't spoon-feed the audience . some have criticized it for being confusing , and it is certainly complex , but attentive viewers should have little trouble following the action . it is surprisingly effective on the emotional level as well for a big budget hollywood spectacle .

> in this excellent historical piece , gary sinise brilliantly portrays president harry s truman . the film , based on the biography by david mccullough , is an excellent presentation of the much longer written work . of necessity , this film greatly abridges the superb book , but it does so in an intelligent manner that still captures the essence of harry truman 's life and political career without either going too long , or cutting too much.the main glory of this film , however , is gary sinise and his portrayal of president truman . he absolutely nails the role , and the result is that what could have been just an average film becomes a brilliant one . mr. sinise manages to convey truman 's guts , essential decency , and yes , his human side as well . i loved him in apollo 13 , and he is even better here , where the starring role allows him to show off his very considerable talents.i recommend seeing the film first , and then reading the book . the film serves as an excellent introduction to the book , and actually stoked my interest in president truman as a man and as a president.highly recommended .

> marc atkins ' `` waterloo companion '' is a remarkably detailed exploration of the battlefield , and the battle at waterloo , the clash between french forces under napoleon and anglo-dutch and prussian armies under wellington and blucher , respectively . adkins has brought together a large collection of information on the armies , the campaign , and the battlefield itself . `` the waterloo companion '' is richly illustrated with maps , diagrams on the locations of units , line and block charts of army organization , and color plates of uniforms . of particular interest to this reviewer were the annotated photographs of the battlefield , which provide a real sense of how the terrain at mount st. jean influenced the conduct and outcome of the fighting . atkins ' supporting prose is spare and to the point , and there is every indication that he done due diligence on his research . atkins attempts to give credit to individual units in describing the flow of the battle , and in the process attempts to clear up a few persistent misunderstandings.this book is highly recommended to students of the battle of waterloo as a major resource of information on the events of 18 june 1815 .

> this innovative album opens with man 's final frontier , a funky number with lots of scratching and samples . it is followed by the amazingly positive and life-affirming mama 's always on stage and people everyday , black pride anthem and intelligent protest against violence.mr wendall is another gem of a song , about homelessness and recognising the dignity in others . it also has a most compelling arrangement and gripping vocals . arrested development highlights personal and social problems without sounding preachy.the jazzy raining revolution is a moving spiritual rap , and fishin ' 4 religion is a critical look at organized religion . the energetic give a man a fish deals with the music business whilst the bubbly uptempo u and the gentle , melodious natural are about love and relationships.dawn of the dreads has lots of pop appeal with its catchy sung parts alternating with the rap ; tennessee has soulful female vocals , and the album concludes on a high note with the spiritual poem washed away . what a great album , so original in sound and uplifting in spirit ! it encompasses a stunning variety of styles in a set of highly accomplished songs .

> this recent novel by rozan was one of the best that i 've read in her lydia chin and bill smith series thus far . a lot of tea drinking and chinese-american drama , plus tons of genuinely hilarious dialogue and some surprising plot twists . rozan spins a good tale , but one of the highlights of this novel is the dialogue ; so sharp and fast it almost makes you dizzy . in addition to likeable duo of chin and smith there are several fascinating , and bizarre , characters that pop up in this novel . i think it 's fair to say that if you 've enjoyed other novels in this series , you 'll be very happy with this one too . rozan 's style is light-hearted and fun , but there also some honest and heartfelt human emotions at play in her books . very enjoyable read .

> personally i find tarantino movies to be excellent homages to previous classic movies ( hanging for django ( una lunga fila di croci ) [ blu-ray ] ) in various genre's.django unchainedis another in his list of hits that should especially appeal to anyone that enjoys a good tongue and cheek western . fans of westerns of the 60s and 70s will find a great deal to enjoy . now although i would have liked even more of a slant towards the `` spaghetti westerns '' and ennio morricone 's delightful music , i understand tarantino wanted to give it greater dimension . i was glad to see him do a cameo . superb directing , good story , great cast , fine sets and outdoor shots , and a variety of music ( i was partial to morricone 's ) . my only slight complaint is the variety of music was kind of all over the place in style and period and to me made the movie slightly disjointed . now i grant you much of the music in the 70s movies was similar , but i did n't like most of it either . i wish quintin tarantino had given full control of the music to ennio morricone and let him run with it . my bet is he would have come up with something like that in the three spaghetti westerns soundtracks ( the good , the bad & the ugly , the man with the harmonica ( soundtrack from the film once upon a time in the west ) , il mio nome & egrave ; nessuno - mon nom est personne - my name is nobody ( bande originale du film de tonino valerii ( 1973 ) ) ) i mentioned and it would have been perfect and i would have given the movie five stars.recommendations : the good , the bad and the ugly ( two-disc blu-ray/dvd combo in blu-ray packaging ) , my name is nobody , andonce upon a time in the west [ blu-ray ] .ca luster

> of all roy 's books , this is closest to an actual collection of build able plans- but it 's still a far cry from the typical project book . there are no cut lists , no detailed assembly guides . at best , you get a measure drawing of the assembled piece . sometimes there are some photos of part of the process . and there is a pretty good guide to cutting dovetails.regular fans of roy 's show will not be surprised by this . one of the biggest lessons i 've taken away from his show is that during much of history , and especially during the early american era roy knows best , woodworkers did n't work to a plan or drawing , using rulers ; they worked to the thing itself . a great example is the six-board chest featured here . there are no fixed dimensions or proportions to this piece of functional furniture ; the size depended on the size of the boards you had . if you have 12 & # 34 ; boards ( as i did ) , you build a 12 & # 34 ; wide chest . if you 've just felled a big tree and milled 20 & # 34 ; boards , you ca build a 20 & # 34 ; wide chest.if you 're a regular fan of the woodwright 's shop , this book ( and roy 's other books ) are a great adjunct to the show , with details , photos , and drawings that allow you to study at leisure the projects roy has to rush through ion his show . while the books are no substitute for a real hands-on class in 18th and 19th century woodworking , they 're a great help to someone trying to learn these techniques on their own .

> three months into the world wide technology outage , the branning family and their neighbors are beginning to get the hang of surviving . they are bartering for what they need and digging a neighborhood well.but then they are robbed . jeff chases after the thieves and discovers they are four children , siblings , who have been living alone for months . against their better judgment , the brannings feel compelled to care for these kids . where is their mother ? and will the brannings be able to feed these extra mouths ? if i were viewing this series as a mystery series , i 'd be highly disappointed . while there are some mysteries surrounding the kids , they develop in fits and starts . and the climax of that story is pretty weak . instead , this is a novel about survival and what humans will do when faced with the end of our civilization . as a result , it is fascinating and page turning . i had a hard time putting the book down . the characters are real , and i found myself asking if i would have the faith and compassion to respond as they did multiple times over the course of the novel.this book relies heavily on the events of the first in the series . there is a recap and character guide in the first few pages , so you could jump in here if you needed to . but i 'd advise you to read them in order . and there are some great develops as far as the overall story goes in this book that made me look forward to the third.this is another challenging and captivating novel from a great writer . if you want a great read , consider this series .

> i will offer a view contrary to several of the other amazon reviewers who seemed to like this book less than the first two in the nightrunner series . i thought that it was at least on par , and in some respects i actually liked it much better.i enjoyed luck in the shadows and stalking darkness . at least , i enjoyed them enough to go ahead and pick up the third . my issue with them was that they were a little too focused on the individual characters . there was a whole lot of destiny and magical quests going on . while flewelling is a fresh writer , parts of the plots felt like stale retreads of similar books in the genre.traitor 's moon goes a lot farther down the road of politics . the aurenfaie became a lot more interesting to me as parties quarreling about trade routes than they were as mystic tolkeinish semi-elves . the plot line with korathan and poria was much more interesting and complex this time around . i was genuinely surprised by some of the character shifts , and that takes some doing.i was a little bit disappointed to see that flewelling has not written with these characters since traitor 's moon . i think that i will wander back over and take another look at the bone doll 's twin . i had read it before i read these three books , and i believe that i am now inclined to give it another chance.the nightrunner series is recommended for swords & sorcery fantasy fans . while it has some adult situations , it should be fine for teenage readers . begin at the beginning with luck in the shadows , and not here with traitor 's moon .

> i do n't drink coffee . when a k-cup brewer machine appeared at work , i did n't pay much attention.however i do like my tea , and buying box after box of teabags gets pretty expensive . the ideal of course , is using whole leaf tea you strain yourself.as much as i like tea , most home filters are terrible . i ca n't believe some people actually use teaballs ! anyway , i was out shopping one night and just happened to see a small stack of ekobrews near the coffee display . noticing this oddly shaped package , i inched closer for a look -- and was amazed . `` holy crap , this thing would make a perfect whole-leaf filter ! `` the next day , i brought my newly purchased ekobrew to the k-brewer -- stuffed full of a new citrus/chammomile whole-leaf tea i really wanted to try . the eko brew fit perfectly inside the brewer 's cup chamber ! a button press later , and my cup rapidly filled with freshly brewed & perfectly filtered tea . yay ! i can enjoy all sorts of teas now , without cross-contaminating anyone 's coffee with my `` sticks n ' twigs '' . and this is not cheap plastic here , but a solidly built & well designed device.whee ! now even i enjoy the k-brewer , even more than the coffee drinkers

> this critter ridder says it is rain resistant and then at one point in their description says heavy rain resistant . when i received it , the weather forecast had a low probability of rain for the next 10 days ; so trusting ? that , since it was the best i could do , i spread this along my problem area for dogs . we have a sidewalk with a grassy median between it and the street and several trees surrounded by hosta gardens that it 's been very irritating , in more ways than one , to find dog waste left in.the directions say to use gloves to spread it , but since the can is a shaker , it seemed much more handy to just give a shaking application that way . i spread it along the edges of the sidewalk and in a ring around the hosta gardens . as luck would have it that evening was one of those 10 % scattered showers , not that heavy of a rain . the next morning there was no trace of the granules or the smell , which had a slight ammonia odor and there in the corner which had probably gotten a heavier dose because that is also where an area the hosta are was a huge pile of dog poop.that sort of destroys my opinion of this product 's effectiveness .

> i have not tried to use this with a cf card reader . however , i have used it with my sd cards extensively , and it works very well for that . if you insert the sd connector into the ipad and go to photos , the ipad will ask you if you wish to import the photos . my big 16mb photos import very quickly , so it does work well . this is what i bought it for so i am basically satisfied.others have complained about problems hooking up usb devices , such as cf card readers , to the usb interface . i will try this later and update this review accordingly.one nit : the ipad interface plug on the sd interface device is shaped such that i must remove my plastic ipad case in order to insert it all the way . it requires space on both sides of the female connector on the ipad to be inserted all the way . i wish that they had not done this.does the job , albeit imperfectly . it really is handy to have the sd card reader after a day of shooting . the ipad is a wonderful way to review photos .

> this memoir fills a gap -- a readable history of the invasions of new britain , peleliu , and okinawa , in the narrative voice of a regular person . burgin sees the stupid side of what he 's doing , lets you know that he knows it 's stupid , then goes ahead and does it because it 's his duty.the book has a `` he said , she said '' vibe as he refutes some of the earlier written memoirs about his unit , but it can stand alone , even if you have not read the other books ( esp `` with the old breed '' by e. b. sledgewith the old breed . i finished escape from davao last month , so the connection between this book and that one ( lt col austin shofner ) was interesting.escape from davaoi was pre-reading this before letting my kids read it -- tough call . the violence is relatively mild , the language veersoften into profanity . i would not give this to a 6th grader , but i think it would be ok for a 9th grader , depending on the kid . your mileage may vary .

> charly is one of many singers poorly represented on cd . a 34-track compilation ( anthology ) was briefly available and i 've already reviewed that.charly was a consistent country hit-maker in the early eighties , with such fine songs as dancing your memory away , sentimental old you and a superb duet with mickey gilley , paradise tonight , but perhaps the best known song here is who 's cheating who . it was her first country number one and was later covered by alan jackson , who took the song back to the country top ten in the mid-nineties.my favorite here is men , a song that highlights the dilemma that women face - they like some things about men , but not others - but it does so in a slightly humorous way , so it should not offend anybody . the forester sisters later did a completely different song titled men , although it uses some of the same ideas.as an introduction to charly 's music , this is brilliant . if you are looking for her other hits , you 'll have to track down a used copy of anthology .

> machete ( danny trejo ) goes south of the border to stop a madman ( demian bichir ) with plans to launch a missile at washington d.c. , only to find that there is a much bigger madman ( mel gibson ) at large with plans to destroy the world.i thought the first film was a lot of fun , and i love the idea that an old man like trejo can enjoy a career as an action star , but we really didn & # 8217 ; t need this sequel , and i have no interest in seeing machete go into space in a future installment . this movie is too long and has too much plot . director robert rodriguez really needed to strip the story down to something more direct with a few big , kick-ass action sequences rather all this scurrying around from plot point to plot point and guest-star to guest-star peppered with little bites of repetitive action . given the lackluster performance and poor quality of this installment , the next should be called & # 8220 ; machete bombs again. & # 8221 ;

> i 'm no teenage fanatic that preaches & quot ; tool 's & quot ; greatness to everyone i meet , but these guys have got to be the envy of every other band in the genre . all of their albums are near perfect , and is simply some of the most powerful , smart , emotional , deep , and flawless music ever laid down . only a few bands have amazed me as much : & quot ; black sabbath & quot ; , & quot ; pink floyd & quot ; , and & quot ; soundgarden & quot ; . i love each other album of theirs , but & quot ; aenima & quot ; might be the best . my only complaint is that a third of the album are & quot ; interludes & quot ; , non-songs that break it up , and are best heard only a few times . but the songs themselves are 5 star moving metal masterpieces .

> the awakening certainly deserves the respect it has gotten for its ground-breaking theme and the skill with which it was written . it 's deplorable that a talent like kate chopin 's was silenced because of the prejudices of her time . that said , upon this my initial reading of this classic , i 'm left with the thought , `` what a waste and how unnecessary . '' it is true that edna did not have m uch experience of life/love , but it appears that after her exploration of edna 's gradual discovery of her self , chopin ran out of ideas and ended edna 's anguish by taking the expected and easy way out . this book could have been so much more had edna been granted more time to work through her confusion and draw upon her own not insubstantial inner resources . it 's difficult to judge something out of its own time and place , but the ending is rather trite and predictable .

> i really admire tawny weber 's talent for creating such beautifully complicated characters . her characters are never dull . the premise of this book is not new , star-crossed-lovers , but ms. weber managed to make it fresh and interesting . the primary couple were stunning - a strong man and woman , multi dimensional and destined for a happily ever after . there are other books in the series , and characters from those books appear in this one , but it stands alone well , no great spoilers . i recommend the series though , a diverse set of stories , each well plotted , fast paced , with beautifully drawn settings , clever dialogue , realistic situations , passionate sex scenes , and compelling , engaging characters . *i was lucky enough to request and receive my copy from netgalley.com in exchange for an honest review .

> my front yard is small but boasts a garden that 's really coming along nicely . the hydrangea was magnificent this year , and the phlox finally seemed established while the echinachea ... well , they do what they do and try to grab territory.so apparently i got past the first two years hump which leaves me with trying out other plants and deer ... and bunnies . as the drought set in these lovely , beautiful vermin turned their sweet brown eyes to my succulent leaves . sooooo , i was really excited about using this havahart motion activated sprinkler to send 'em scurrying . however it was a bust.first thing we noticed was that the cavity where the batteries go in did n't seem waterproof . next we noticed that this think sits almost at ground level . how the heck is it supposed to work if the plants it 's `` guarding '' are 3-to-5 times higher than it is.i was going to duct-it to a pole , but found out that the effort would n't be worth my while until i could work out how to get it from leaking like a sieve . my husband and i both tried to take it apart , refit the o-ring , and reattach the hose but nothing worked . at least half the water was leaking out at the bottom . and if we had left it out over night by morning our well 's reserve tank would have been emptied.so real bust . i 'm going to head out to the hardware store at some point and see if a different o-ring might cure the problem . but right now i would n't suggest anyone spend more than a quarter on one of these.actually puts out a nice spray to 'water ' the garden , but i do n't believe you 'll be scaring any fauna.pam t~mom/fur-mom/bird feeder/gardener

> sometime in the past of england , some brave nights set out to slay a dragon . they were not very successful , but the dragon 's flame set off their gunpowder and caused a cave-in that trapped the dragon.in present day , dean cain is the new head of security for an underground lab facility . he arrives piloting a helicopter and bringing with him the lead scientist who is clutching a sample case . once at the facility , dean learns that they are , indeed , performing cloning and that the scientist has a new sample . he got it in england so you can guess what it is.an attempt is made at cloning the new sample , it develops much more rapidly than it should and it escapes into the facility . the facility setting actually made it easier on the animators as all of the sets the creature was in looked the same and only allowed one posture . a few plot twists put a time limit on when the survivors must get out of the facility and the tension builds . the ending is typical but still fun with a few shades from other movies.the odd part of the movie is that the new head of security seems to have no security clearance and everyone outranks him . he can not open doors and much of the facility is off-limits to him . there seems to be a complete lack of security systems ( although there are some lab cameras that conveniently stop working when the plot demands ) . this all makes the film lighter than was probably intended but does add to the entertainment value of the film .

> i have been a fan of the goo goo dolls since 1993 's `` superstar car wash '' album , and much has been made of their slow but sure `` make-over '' from an all-out rock/punk sound to a more ballad-oriented band following the mega-hits `` name '' and `` iris '' . i never had a problem with that , so long as the music was actually good . `` let love in '' ( 11 tracks , 42 min . ) starts off promisingly with a catchy `` stay with me '' , followed by the engaging title track . after that , though , the album falters badly , with too many middle-of-the-road songs from lead sinder-guitarist johnny rzeznik that do n't grab you and just meander on . bassist robbie tacak 's `` listen '' provides a rare burst of energy , but it 's not enough unfortunately . the faithfull 2005 cover of supertramp 's `` give a little bit '' hit is also included here.since the 1995 commercial break-out album `` a boy named goo '' , the goo goo dolls only have released a mere 3 studio albums , and this one is by far the weakest on them , there is no other way around it . i do n't pine for a return to the early `` punk '' days , but after a 4 year lay-off from the excellent `` gutterflower '' album , i was expecting better things . given that `` let love in '' did not do well commercially , it 'll be interesting to see where the band goes from here .

> `` paranormal activity 2 '' is a prequel to the horror film released in 2009. the new chapter , which takes place several months before the events described in the first entry , revolves around kristi rey ( sprague grayden ) , sister of the original 's heroine katie ( katie featherston ) , and kristi 's family - daniel ( brian boland ) , his teenage daughter ali ( molly ephraim ) and a baby named hunter.the basic storyline is almost the same as the first installment . in a sense this is not surprising . perhaps the producers thought ( rightly ) that they had to turn the previous year 's surprise hit into a franchise quickly . so in `` pa2 '' scares sometimes look recycled , using unexpected loud sound and moving objects . despite the new characters ( and a dog ) , sometimes i felt as if watching a remake , not a prequel , of the earlier film.the story of `` paranormal activity 2 '' ( especially its introductory part ) unfolds at a faster speed . with footage ostensibly shot by the family 's camcorder and several surveillance cameras installed in the house , the film tries to retain the same visual touch as the first one , but the tighter editing and more polished camerawork ( and special effects ) suggest a bigger budget and professional skills behind the supernatural phenomena.that is not bad thing . `` paranormal activity 2 '' delivers what it promises to deliver . only that novelty is gone .

> this is a well rounded collection of some of anita 's best work with gene krupa 's band , which was her first big break . it is not the ultimate collection -young anitacome pretty close to that - but a solid one.the april 24 , 2011 review is by an o'day expert whom i know personally . he caught a major mistake : on deep in the blues the vocalist is irene daye who preceded anita in the krupa band . that mistake notwithstanding , this album does contain the pearls from that era in my opinion , and can be downloaded for immediate gratification . if you do not need the album immediately and are willing to spend a little more , i , like mr. moore , recommend getting theyoung anitaalbum instead.if you are a die hard fan , this album will make chapters v through vii come alive in anita 's autobiography , high times hard times . also , if you want to go beyond her early years into what i call the verve years you can augment this album with 8 classic albums , which , like this album , is a perfect complement to her book.overall , you can not go wrong with this album if you love anita 's work in her early years . there are other alternatives for the hard core fan , which are cited above , but this is still a good deal in my opinion . the sample tracks say it better than i. trust your ears .

> thanks to netflixinstant recently i was able to see this film , do n't know if i would watch it again on instant free or purchase it or rent it to watch it again , however the baader meinhof complex to me shows the left at it 's best ( or worst which is the same ) , the movie takes an `` amoral '' stand or a moral equivalency as if terrorism can be excused , the movie is tediously long but i think falls short of truly demonizing these spoiled kids who do n't know what imperialism is only that america is bad , nevermind that america saved everyone during wwii , nevermind that it was us and not the germans who unified the new germany.as usual america has to clean up the mess the foreigners have done , they rail and moan about their parents standing by while a so-called fascism returns , they are wrong for they have become the new fascists , and incredibly the new left did not/does not realize how fascist they have become . ( the occupy movement comes to mind in order to mimic the successful resurgence of conservatism ) the best part is when they say `` they believe in a myth '' that is so true but it could have been done better and not some `` psychological '' treatment or come to understanding with these criminals .

> my wife and i wanted a recumbent exercise bike , so we checked the online reviews at consumer reports . the schwinn 213 was the second highest rated , and # 1 cost about four times as much as the schwinn . amazingly , amazon ships this 100+ pound equipment for free , so we ordered it.as others noted , the instructions are not perfect , but some of the mistakes noted by others had been corrected in the instructions that came with ours . it also appeared that some design deficiencies have been corrected , making the bike easier to assemble . assembly took about two hours.as with others , the shipping box was pretty well beat up , but nothing was damaged or missing.we love the bike . it has a good , solid feel and looks like it will last a long time ( but we 've only had it a week ) . all of the programs make it very versatile and flexible . my wife and i are different heights , but it 's very simple to adjust , and it only takes a few seconds . we love to read or watch tv while pedaling.highly recommended !

> bodum stands for quality in function as well as design , which is certainly evident in our bodum chambord french press coffee maker . coffee is more than delicious and the preparation a breeze.the coffee maker is attractive with a chrome plated steel top and trim . a black bakelite handle provides a secure grip and is ergonomically friendly.we 'd recommend using a rather coarse grind of coffee as a fine grind may clog the filter , and stir with a plastic or wooden spoon rather than metal . those two suggestions aside simply measure coffee , heat water and pour water over coffee in carafe . let brew for about 3 - 4 minutes before using the pressing mechanism . then , depress this mechanism slowly , and there you are - the best coffee this side of paree.you 'll think it could n't be any better , but next time add frothed milk ( bodum does make a superior frother ) or a dash of whipped cream sprinkled with a small dash of cinnamon . tres bien ! - gail cooke

> nice follow-up to 'dream police ' . originally released in 1980 , as this was the band 's sixth lp . i remember the day this record came out and even though many critics did n't care for it , 'all shook up ' was fine with most fans . i saw the tour for this very album , as i believe it was only like my tenth concert i ever attended . most memorable tunes , without a doubt are `` stop this game '' , the eye-opener `` just got back '' , '' ca n't stop it , but i 'm gon na try '' , `` i love you honey , but i hate your friends '' and the off-beaten path ditty penned by drummer bun e.carlos `` who 'd king '' . was fun to hear this song played for the finale encore . always have considered cheap trick to be best described as 'heavy pop ' . recommended .

'shoes to die for ' can claim a first , the murder method . not to give anything away , i can only say i have never heard of death caused in this manner by this instrument . a non-mysterious highlight is , no doubt , the heroines nautical date . enough to make even the most love-starved divorcee think twice about re-entering the dating arena . i would not recommend this book to devotees of the classic mystery ; others should be entertained .

> i received the sunbeam 350-watt stand mixer through amazon vine . i would n't have chosen the red color , as it stands out too much in my kitchen ( most kitchens , i 'm guessing ) . but i took what i could get ! the mixer was very easy to put together - the bowl and beaters slide in nicely . as one who 's used to hand-beaters , the different settings were handy was all around easy to use . the instructions were great and even included some recipes . another nice feature was the lever to move the bowl around so the beaters can reach the sides of the bowl . the mixer is very quiet compared to others . and clean-up is a breeze . this works as well as other much more expensive models . highly recommend .
= works well
< great mixer

> my favorite stylus ... just bought more ! cute polka dots but what i love about these is their size . they are longer and a tad wider . i like the way they feel in my hand.update : i am buying more today while the are my favorite i have now thrown out three of these i play games on my kindles with these so the rubber tips break . three is a lot since i only bought them on may 20th ! that is 2 weeks and 3 days . i ca n't risk scratching my screen.for me they are worth it because they feel the best in my hand and like this size . i do n't mind with this price that they are disposable . this may bother other people .

> rodeo by cristina grenier is a mesmerizing love story that will both captivate and ignite your senses . the author is talented to say the least . tommy and eva literally grew into each other . first as innocent kids working dutifully on the farm together but as their underdeveloped body 's matured so did their internal connections.of course there needs to be a little drama here and the author does this with john- i 'll tell you in advance he 's quite the prick ! i do n't want to give it all away but i will tell you i was definitely smiling in the end . my thoughts are you need to read this book for a little bit of heaven whether you 're into cowboys or not- bravo !
= wow ! beautifully written love story !

> this product is what it says it is . the display is all gray scale . no color . it is lightweight compared to other devices . it is simple to use , but is not like a tablet . no pinching . it only holds 1,000 ( +/- ) books . it 's a good idea to manage your kindle on your computer instead of the kindle paperwhite . the processor is a bit slower than other devices like tablets and smart phones , but that does n't matter . once the desired book is loaded up , you do n't notice the slower processor .
= read carefully before purchase

> no sure how to really rate a product like this as there are so many flash drives out there . this is nice in that it is small and tucks into the slot so you can leave it like having a small auxiliary drive . it seems fast enough and large enough for the price . usually i wait for sales to buy flash drives ... this had a good sale price by a respected supplier . i would not buy a drive from an unknown as they tend to be flaky or short lived .
= small and it works fine

> i lived through transformer `` action figures '' ... theydid a animation series and movie on this in the '80 's with famous voices.the special effects are n't that special or believable.this movie is the second movie starring shia labeouf that i 've reviewdand i think megan fox was a bigger attraction.shape shifting robots is a pretty far out ideaeven now . it is all actionwith very little acting or dialog : the plotis roswell , area 51 and the thing meets the invaders from outer space : pure b movie .

> all that needs to be said about this show has already been said by bloggers , but it really is the best show on television . the final season of breaking bad changed my perception of what could be done with a tv show - it 's like a movie , or an hbo series , that aired on standard cable . if you have an hdtv , it 's best to watch it in hd . but seriously - watch . this . show .

> i was hesitant to buy another electronic scale after my first experience . but this company is doing it right . we have been using it for about one month . it is consistent and my wife reported that it weighed her approximately the same as her doctor 's scale . it is very easy to see the read out and we both like the width of the scale . you can spend more , but why would you ?

> when i first looked at reviews for this game , i fought it would be a very hard game for me to play and i wanted to delete it . as i began to play temple run 2 , it became very clear to me that is was going to be a suspenseful game filled with action and thinking skills.this game is great , and it also keeps me aware of the big monkey behind me !

> the bottom line : convoluted and overlong , the godfather part iii should be commended for trying to tell a different story ( i and ii were essentially two parts of the same tale ) and for its several powerful scenes , but it 's too messy a film to be worth recommending , and that 's not mentioning the unimpressive turn by sofia coppola .

> i am so sad . i purchased the beautiful hot pink 2 gb sansa clip a couple of years ago and loved it . never had problems with it . i decided to upgrade so i can put more songs on and figured my niece would love my old pink one . unfortunately , i did n't test out my 4 gb sansa before giving away my old one . i used it once without issues , but the second time i used it , it died in the middle of a song and would not turn back on again . i am not even going to bother trying to troubleshoot as this is troubling to me that sansa quality has gone way down . i noticed this right away when i opened the package . this 4 gb sansa has a cheaper plastic than the old 2 gb one . it looked cheap overall because of the type of plastic used . disheartened , i figured as long as it works , i will keep it . unfortunately , it proved to not only be cheap on the outside , but on the inside as well . want to give sansa another try , but am very leery , especially as other 1 star reviewers mentioned similar issues , even replacing their 4 gb sansa 2-3 times . no way . i am trying to talk my niece into giving me back my pink one since it is no longer available ... lolupdate 5/31/13 : just wanted to update to say that my sansa was replaced during the warranty period sometime last year and seems to work fine thus far ( increased my amazon star rating to 4 ) . it has n't be utilized as much or as long as the one mentioned earlier . i will try to keep everyone updated should i encounter any issues in the future .

> the sopranos ' first season was an instant sensation . hailed by many critics as one of the best shows ever created , the second season was highly anticipated . instead of succumbing to the dreaded sophomore jinx , series creator david chase mixed things up by introducing new characters while wisely keeping a strong spotlight on the amazing james gandolfini . mr. gandolfini strikes a commanding presence as mob boss tony soprano . he is asked to carry a heavy load by being the center of a complex and intricate show and he gives a brilliant , multi-layered performance . michael imperioli has an even greater role as young mobster christopher moltisanti . his work in the episodes where he is shot and almost dies are outstanding . tony sirico again provides strong work and comic relief as paulie walnuts and vincent pastore is great as the paranoid and ill-fated big pussy bompansiero . aida turturro is introduced as tony 's seemingly spacey , but calculating and scheming sister janice and david proval as the menacing richie aprille , younger brother to the late jackie aprille and who has spent the last ten years in jail . he 's back and he becomes a thorn in tony 's side . edie falco is excellent as tony 's beleaguered wife carmella , but the one sour note to season is lorraine bracco 's dr. melfi . she is conflicted about treating tony and the continuing storyline about her ex-husband 's disapproval of the situation and the image of italian-americans seems forced . that is the one lowlight as season two lives up to the hype . the sopranos is more like a mini-movie each week , rather than a television show and the dvd format only enhances the viewing experience . this set is a must have .
= stellar second season

> `` water for elephants '' was the last book club selection i read , and it was not my choice . reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it , i felt like i was back in high school . but like i did in school , i learned something . i learned about what it is like to be in a circus , to know what drives someone to join a circus , especially in a different generation . the main protagonist , jacob jankowksi , however , was a likable character and i liked his spunk . each chapter is narrated by the old and young jacob . the old version would be looking back in time , thus , the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined , and when he met the woman he would fall in love with . the writing at times , really did n't give me any feeling that i could not put this book down . there is something about ms. gruen 's writing that i just ca n't put into words other than : i did n't care for it , and i do n't think she 's a very good writer.i am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything . this is one book that i feel i wasted far too much time on . i did n't even really finish it as i was still several chapters away from the end the night before our meeting.take a look at my reviews to see some really wonderful books and see if you agree with me.eileen f .

> this fast paced thriller sees rock star turned disgraced private eye cum `` security consultant '' nicholas colt drawn into a diabolical game orchestrated by a malignant billionaire . colt take the case of a nervous accountant who receives a letter demanding his participation in a reenactment of a violent video game . the penalty for ignoring the invitation is death . colt dismisses the letter as either a joke or a ruse to facilitte a burglary . he does agree to go to the site himself . once there he realizes that this is no joke and he is forced in a kill or be killed struggle with other participants . although seemingly outmatched by his younger opponents ' physical prowess , colt relies on a resourcefulness gained from years of experience . when his estranged wife is forced into the game , he makes it his mission to win at all costs.this was a tightly written , suspenseful tale . i was rooting for colt . i was glad that juliet , the wife , was not reduced to a hand wringing damsel in the distress . she proved as intelligent and courageous as her husband . the language is strong and the violence graphic , although probably not much worse than an average night of criminal minds and csi . that being said , it is definitely not for the faint of heart or stomach.i recommend this exciting book . it is a fast read that will entertain til the end . well done .

> kitty and ben have decided to tie the knot . unlike her older sister , cheryl , kitty does n't want a frou-frou wedding . she 'd just settle for some frou-frou drinks.so , she and ben opt to elope to vegas . the story might have ended there if she had n't told her producer , who suggested that kitty have her first televised show in vegas before the wedding . then , kitty told her mom , who insisted on coming along . oh yeah , and her friend rick the vampire wanted her to contact dom , the master of vegas for him.between researching and putting on a show , dealing with family , and delivering messages , kitty and ben are determined to get married . but , wait -- ben wins a seat in a half-million dollar poker championship . and , kitty meets a magician who may be the real thing . let 's not forget the gun convention going on with werewolf hunting bounty hunters in attendance.the plot 's definitely complex . almost too much so , but vaughn manages to pull the storyline off . the story 's obviously continued in part as well , so `` dead man 's hand '' is not quite as satisfying as its predecessors . still , the story 's engaging and the series has enough life in it that i 'm waiting anxiously for `` kitty raises hell '' which is coming in march.rebecca kyle , january 2009

> i ca n't get through this puppy . no way no how . i try i try i try . the dialog gets me every time . it 's as suave as a shave with a rusty razor on a dry three day stubble , and leaves me about as raw.even though the plot is exciting , there is something about the style of the writing that puts me off . and i read lots of things , junky novels , classics , sci fi , biographies -- good and bad and this is one of the few books i just could n't even read . that 's strange , even stranger because it is a monster bestseller . it may be the style of short sentences that lacks a certain flow that i like when i am reading . possibly , i 'd like this book better in audio form.i suppose the idea of the holy grail ending up in france ... oops spoiler , is alluring and great for fans of the grail myth , but i could n't get into this book in the least . i could give it five stars for being incredibly bad and still earning megabucks and having a film . that , now that , takes talent . what kind i am not sure , but it 's a talent .

> this story is an easy read and yet it 's very deep . this young boy was on the doorstep of death and had what would be termed a near death experience . through the years he would tell his parents part of his experience until they finally felt like they needed to put this book together.this book is lovely and full of hope.i particularly like that his views reflect mine although he 's of another religion than i am.the other thing that i really liked about this book is that it was n't preachy . the author todd burpo is a pastor of a church and at no time did i feel he was trying to convert me , change my beliefs or force me to believe in a loving god . he simply put it out there , this is what my son says he saw . he shares his confusion about it , his reluctance to admit at first that his son might have been to heaven , and his eventual conversion.overall , this is a fascinating book full of hope .

> otterbox is well known for a reason , they make tough quality cases . i was a little concerned that there is no cover over the earpiece or camera , however they are recessed enough that i 've had no trouble at all with scratching or smudging even . the clip is tough and definitely useful as a point of attachment , but also as a stand for watching videos . the rubber outer case has definitely improved since the cases for the 3gs 's . the outer shell feels much sturdier and i have a feeling it will outlast the old style rubber . installation and removal has improved drastically as well . i 'm not annoyed when i want to take my phone out of this case as i was with older models . overall , a great product i 'd recommend to anyone looking for something to make their phone outlast everybody with clip on cases .

> labyrinth remains as one of best examples of a fairy tale movie made right that has ever been made . jim henson successfully combined muppets , live actors , and bizarre sets to create one of the best fantasy movies of all time . adding to those elements is the unique soundtrack of the film . all of the musical numbers by david bowie and most of the original music composed by trevor jones is contained on this album . i bought the album because i loved the movie . out of all the music and songs it contains , `` magic dance '' is the one that stands out above the rest . it 's the only song on the album that i find myself playing over and over and over and over again . there are several other interesting tunes , but the album is worth buying alone just to have `` magic dance .

> the century multi 300 count seems to be a really good deal . if you compare it to one-a-day and other dailies , it provides more vitamins and minerals : 31 in all.i particularly like that the century multi has 100 % of daily iron requirements , as well as folic acid and minerals like boron , chromium , and tin.each tablet is fairly large . they are odorless and a nice rosy color . and unlike other vitamins i 've used lately , these tabs have marks so that you can easily divide them if you want to take a half in the morning , and another half in the evening . or if your doctor recommends only half a dose.as i write this , these vitamins are a good value . nearly a whole year in one bottle .

> crosby , stills , nash & young + dallas taylor & greg reeves / d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu : the csny masterpiece . the influence that their participation at the woodstock festival had on this album is so obvious that it is hard to think of one without thinking of the other . there is the very dated hippie tune , `` almost cut my hair '' but even that song is a delight in the context of this great album . there are so many classic songs here that it serves as its own greatest hits package . if you do n't have this one , you ought to get it . highly recommended .

> my grandson has not had to try this within the last 30 days , so i gave this a taste test . it does taste like grape , although the syrup does not look like it . it is very sweet but there is no medicine aftertaste , something i would think infants would not care for . this comes with a syringe to use on the very smallest of children.i can see how this would help soothe a small child 's raw throat over a few days , by gently coating the sore throat . i like the taste of this , and i would recommend this for infants because it lacks medicine and other unpleasant tastes .

> gwen stefani wears her 80 's influences on her sleeves which is cool at times , but then it becomes one big cliche . that is the problem with this album which is basically the cutting room floor material that was n't good enough to make it on her debut album . i was n't that fond of her debut album & this album is a set below that one . vocally she sounds like she is trying to channel 80 's era madonna , cyndi lauper , deborah harry with mixed results . the production is a dime a dozen & the songwriting is just bland . gwen needs to go back to no doubt like yesterday .

> before this album , i had only heard cusco 's & quot ; water stories & quot ; and this one definitely was better , yet it did n't hit my musical fibers in the ways that new age acts such as vangelis or jean-michel jarre have been able to . & quot ; tula , & quot ; & quot ; xul-kan & quot ; and & quot ; maya temple & quot ; stand out , with & quot ; goddess of the moon & quot ; being the best track in the album . for more 'ancient american'-sounding music , i would recommend listening to gustavo santaolalla 's 'ronroco .

> in the prime of his creative powers , peter gabriel presents a breathtaking world music tour-de-force that goes beyond a movie soundtrack.the score is centered on traditional north african rhythms and sounds , with the 21 tracks featuring talent from pakistan , turkey , india , ivory coast , bahrain , egypt , new guinea , morocco , senegal and ghana . david sancious , billy cobham and david rhodes also contribute on a number of selections.several of the pieces do not appear in the film , hence the project stands alone on its own merits . the cd is definitely a diamond in gabriel 's dynamic delivery of definitive artistry .

> i read this book with my nine-year-old niece . it 's really something that i think will mostly benefit a tween/early teenage girl audience . for what it is , the book is pretty cool : a famous supermodel giving her take on life lessons , self-esteem , etc . yes , the writing itself is a bit repetitive and fluffy , but then again , i think it 's perfect for a super young audience . if miranda kerr 's goal was to reach women ages 20+ , she failed miserably . however , i think younger girls will enjoy this and benefit from the author 's positive messages .

> i have used a waterpik for many years , but my old one was dying , and there were features of its design which i believe contributed to its demise . from what i have seen so far , this model avoids the issues i had with the older unit . my only issue with this is that although it came with 6 or 7 tips ( all of different types ) i would have preferred a smaller selection , which included two or three of the basic tip . instead , i must now buy these separately , at what seems an inordinately high price .

> with tribe , queensryche has issued their third straight solid , but not outstanding , hard rock album . much like its predecessor ( q2k ) , tribe starts out on the right foot with two catchy , harder-hitting songs . unfortunately it never really picks up from there . while there are some good moments , the rest of the album just seems to run together and does n't seem to offer any standout tracks . it is a decent album though , and if you enjoyed their last two releases then you will probably enjoy tribe as well . if you 're expecting a return to the band'soperation : mindcrime/empire/promised landera of greatness , then you will be disappointed here.it 's becoming obvious that the band 's best days are behind them , and that frontman geoff tate is determined to steer the band as far away from their progressive metal roots as he can . in fact , empire was probably the last queensryche release that could really be considered metal at all . since then the band has issued a string of progressively less impressive hard rock albums . viewed on their own , they might be considered quality albums , and they all have their merits , but when you compare them to the bands first 5 albums , you ca n't help but be a bit disappointed.while i am not yet ready to give up on the band ( i 'm hoping that with degarmo back in the fold he can counter some of tate 's madness ) , tribe may turn out to be the straw that broke the camel 's back to many long-time fans .

> venice in the early renaissance was a perilous in the extreme . innocent or guilty , prominent or poverty stricken , an individual could be destroyed in the blink of an eye , if it suited the aims of the politically powerful . the age of scientific enlightenment was dawning , but superstition and `` heresy '' still abounded under the iron rule of the church . luciano , a street urchin , is offered a rare opportunity to transform his life by the chef of the doge , who is not merely a culinary master . chef ferraro is one of the guardians , a network of educated men who are living and dying to preserve priceless knowledge that church and government are eager to obliterate . together , ferraro and luciano undertake the perilous task of preserving this knowledge and denying it to the autocrats.the book of unholy mischief is chock full of mystery , intrigue , hope , and violence . it is also an argument for `` free thinking '' , in such a way that the religious sensibilities of some readers will be offended . those who can approach it with open mind will discover much to enjoy : vivid characters , food for thought , great atmosphere and period detail , an appreciation for humanistic values . life in the kitchen of the doge 's palace is portrayed so expressively that the mouth waters . while the plot sometimes loses its tension , its underlying message , that true magic lies not in sorcery but in learning , is beautifully conveyed .

> this is a great cyber thriller and sandra bullock does an excellent job portraying a female computer geek . the directing , casting , sets , and music are first class . those of us that are in the computer industry and those who are not will both enjoy it . i 'm a senior engineer that has worked with computers for twenty plus years and i saw it when it was first released.when i first saw this movie , only one thing amused me , the wolfenstein game , it 's the movies only shortcoming . at the time the movie was released the game was old news and they carry on about how the game is state of the art . it did n't ring true with those of us that were on the bleeding edge of the gaming community . they should not have put the game in or came up with something that looked high tech since the game dates it . perhaps snobbery , but true nonetheless.as i said before it was the only shortcoming . this movie is excellent and the mood is like a hitchcockian or grisham thriller . well paced and it keeps you guessing what 's next . the threat of identity theft and large computer companies failing because of faulty software today only shows how in that respect the movie was ahead of it 's time . i never tire of watching it . the dvd quality is good , but unfortunately it does not include any extras . still well worth buying a copy .
= good cyber thriller

> if you have read the author 's a time to kill , you 'll be familiar with the location of the story and the main characters . sycamore row occurs a few years after a time to kill.numerous mississippi lawyers line up on opposing sides of a large estate battle . there are two conflicting wills and a lot of money involved , so there are lawyers ` coming out of the woodwork ' trying to get a piece of it.there 's also some complicated detective work : tracking down long-lost relatives and piecing together a very fragmented family tree.having watched the movie version of a time to kill , i liked that i was able to envision the characters that carried-over to sycamore row ( like jake and lucien and several others ) .overall though , i thought this story got bogged-down and i did a lot of skimming to get to the end . way too many lawyers to keep track of ... ... ..way too much complicated family tree ... ... .way too much courtroom detail ... ... . and way too many pages.like a time to kill , i think this book will also make a good movie ( once the movie editors cut the story down to size ) .

> features first : the film cuts down on glare in direct sunlight and is easy to keep clean . there is also no reduction in sensitivity : my phone responds exactly the same to finger movements after i installed this protector as it did before i applied it.i 've tried installing protective shields in the past and always had bubbles to show for my efforts . for this review sample , though , i had some practice on theiraceshield samsung galaxy note iiversion . that one was not only easy , but resulted in a perfect application of the protector.this one is identical , except it 's for the slightly larger note 3. i am guessing that the secret to this brand is the adhesive or possibly the thinness of the film - or both . regardless , this protector is a breeze to install ( without bubbles ) if you follow the instructions to the letter.all of the tools needed to install the protector are included . the process is four simple steps than even a klutz like myself can follow . i am thrilled with the results and recommend this brand because it is easy to attain professional results .

> fast , large , reliable , well priced.that really is it and really does say it all . that is until the 64gb version becomes as cheap as this which it will do over time and then that card will become the perfect card . by that point though we 'll be seeing even faster speed cards and there will be more variables for sure . right here though and right now this card is the perfect sdhc card for your camera.1 . you ca n't argue with the price as this card is a bit of a bargain these days.2 , it 's a sandisk extreme , top of their line card for reliability.3 . it a fast class 10 card which means it will and does record hd video continuously without any problems.4 . it 's a 32gb card which is plenty is n't it ? be honest you know it is . : - ) buy it , put it in your camera and just forget about it .

> i have long untreated hair these days and i purchased this product because i wanted something to keep the ends from drying out . much to my surprise this leave-in spray did n't seem to do that ; my hair was really fly-away.the other thing i did n't like was that it did n't help at all with detangling , which personally i think is required . i mean after you use the evercreme shampoo and conditioner , the next product should be a detangler/nourishing one . certainlyl'oreal 's eversleek , humidity defying leave-in cr & egrave ; meincludes detangling as one of it 's functions . and that 's the product that i 'm going to go back to.a disappointing experience . i think l'oreals ' nourishing leave-in spray does n't do enough . first because it seemed like it was actually drying out my hair , and second because it does n't protect it from snarls.pam t~

> ` libertad ' is the second album from velvet revolver and it has a much more coherent feel about it . the sound is refined , the riffs are more powerful and the band seem to have gelled more . produced by the great brendan o'brien you already have an inkling about what this album will offer and from the opener ` let it roll ' you know you wo n't be disappointed . slash plays better on this album and his distinctive sound is to the fore throughout and scott weiland sounds more polished and at ease than on ` contraband ` . if you enjoyed their first album it 's a safe bet you 'll be impressed by this and if you found ` contraband ' to be lacking then give this a try , you may be pleasantly surprised.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> the music of omd has given me joy for many , many years , so i was thrilled to get this & # 34 ; comeback & # 34 ; album and find that it had the same magical vibe as their older , classic material . so much so , that this album could bookend any of the ones that they put out in the early 1980s and it would sound , and feel , perfectly right.this cd truly is electro-pop bliss ! many catchy songs , and a few that could inspire you to hit the dance floor , but omd also still have that a darker , creative edge that colors other tunes . but rest assured , when these guys want to write songs with hooks , they know how to do it , and they still are doing it very well . a great sounding return to form .

> yes , one star for this stereo typical studio tactic . initially releasing only the theatrical versions until sales have dwindled to nothing and then we get the `` new and improved '' product that they had waiting under their wings the whole time.holding out on us huh ? why i otta ... i strongly recommend that you and i the customers eliminate this pathetically transparent / double your money making sleazy tactic and not ! repeat , not purchase these releases . we have the money . they want our money . we have the power to stop this greedy tactic by being smart enough not to keep buying into this . do we want to complain ? or do we want to finally take a stand ? what could be simpler . just do n't buy it ! i 'm not .

> this is an outstanding novel . i was impressed by how meyer packs a tremendous amount of action into the work 's beginning -- indeed , the first hundreds of pages feature a great deal of death , destruction , and impending danger ( all of which is extremely well-written ) -- only then to write a somewhat quieter book throughout the remaining hundreds of pages . it was almost as though the author was trying to convey how significant action can ultimately lead to significant introspection across generational lines and across time . meyer excelled at both types of writing -- the fast and the slow , the loud and the quiet . in sum , this is a great book that says a lot about america -- where it has been and where it is going .

> this review is from : unu aero series iphone 5s battery case / iphone 5 battery with wireless charging technology - ( black , fits all models apple iphone 5s & iphone 5 ) ( wireless phone accessory ) it feels good to have enough power to go all day with my phone . this battery does that because its battery is 2000mah . the iphone is a battery hog and apple has a new battery in development that will modify energy usage based on the user 's habits . until then , i believe this unu aero iphone battery is the best solution outside of charging one 's iphone here and there during the day.the main attributes of an external battery are weight and volume . this battery case has a small footprint in both regards . in fact , it serves as a protective case that doubles as an extra battery . i like the feel and look of the case.this leads to a different and better routine . place the phone down on the charging pad . it 's slightly magnetized so it will hold in place correctly . let the phone and battery charge as if they 're one unit . in the morning , take off the plate and go . do n't recharge all day . this cycle will also lengthen the battery lifespan.truly i could not find any fault in this product . as for the lack of a longer cable , it does n't affect me because i have too many extra cables . i was fortunate to receive a complimentary sample . this is my honest review .
= a lot of power for very little extra weight
< best solution outside of charging one 's iphone 5s

> i can see why people love this romeo and juliet -- the bso plays with real elegance , a rare attribute in this score ( or generally in prokofiev recordings ) . if you want the two lovers to walk on a cloud , this is the performance for you . ozawa 's fondness for wisp , gossamer textures is refreshing , but he misses a great deal of the passionate , aggression , and sarcasm in prokofiev 's writing , which matches a story full of those qualities . you sense immediately that this is a ballet but not that it 's a tragedy.i think romeo and juliet is prokofiev 's masterpiece , and i eagerly attended the live performances associated with this recording . after half an hour of ozawa tip-toeing around the score and smoothing out every rought edge and sharp corner , i became drowsy and left at intermission . in the end elegance is n't enough , and the lack of passion here proves fatal . there are wonderful recordings of excerpts from the ballet , including mitropoulos on sony , salonen , also on sony , abbado on dg , etc . for a complete version , maazel with the cleveland orch . on decca has the benefit of great sound and impact , but the conducting tends to be coarse and uninvolving . gergiev is totally involved , but philips did n't give the kirov orch . very clear or vivid sound ( in concert they are incomparable in this work ) . still , i 'd put gergiev first by quite a distance over ozawa .

> we own four sets of this corelle dinnerware and we have had them for over 30 years . they are as tough as nails and they look new after all that time and they have been used every day . they are really tough . i think we have broken two items in about 35 years out of the over 100 items we own . my wife even dropped a coffee cup onto a cement floor and it bounced and did not break.corelle is microwave and dishwasher safe and that is how we have washed them every day for all of those years . the plates and bowls all look brand new like they have never been used . i have included two photos for your information . we have several of the corelle bowls in white and they are great soup and cereal bowls.the corelle products are simply top notch quality and they last forever and keep on looking good . if you are looking for something for everyday use that will hold up i think that corelle is the best product you will find . i strongly recommend them to you as a great product !

> these classroom playsets are a great addition to the monster high dolls . there 's a lot of playvalue since the mh dolls ' companions/familiars have been replaced with a locker with working lock , school prop ( ghoulia has a ball ) , extra outfit ( in ghoulia 's trademark red , white , and black ) , and accessories.ghoulia 's classroom is pe - she comes in her gym outfit and with her killer handball . her hair is a bit messy coming out of the box but brushes out easily enough.the locker is quite cute - in addition to being a store place for her accessories , it has a little skull lock that opens and closes to secure the locker . no more having to worry about things falling out accidentally.the locker has a sports bottle extra glasses , brush , pen , notepad . in addition , there are fun mh stickers with which to decorate the inside or outside of the locker.in all , a great little set . i especially liked the extra outfit for her !

> i 'm not sure how it happened that i have never read three act tragedy ( sometimes known as murder in three acts ) . i had assumed that this would be a re-read . but as i really did not remember the plot , i guess that this was either the first time that i have read it , or i read it so long ago as to no longer register.as poirots go , this is considered a minor example . the moustached detective plays a relatively small part , and the characters are perhaps not quite as strong as in other christie classics.there are still many interesting aspects to the novel . christie 's use of misdirection is masterful , and she actually allows us to dislike a number of her choices until everything becomes clear at the end . she seems to be saying some smart things about relationships , and egg is a good example of the christie female hero.i read it while on vacation , and can heartily recommend that you do the same .

> leif ove andsnes ' latest traversal of grieg 's lyric pieces compares favorably to emil gilels ' distinguished 1974 recording for deutsche grammophon . although gilels ' interpretations may seem a bit more polished , i suspect that may be due more to the sound quality , which surprisingly is slightly better on the earlier analogue recording . still , emi has done a fine job capturing andsnes ' lively , warm performances of selections from grieg 's lyric pieces , most of which are n't identical with those performed by gilels . in stark contrast to gilels , andsnes tends to emphasize the lyrical qualities - no pun intended - of grieg 's music , at the expense of technique , yet by no means should one rate andsnes an inferior pianist . i am greatly impressed with the deep sonority and rich tones of grieg 's 1892 steinway , which andsnes exploits successfully in each of his performances . fans of andsnes ' playing and grieg 's music will certainly acquire this fine cd .
= andsnes ' splendid playing of grieg 's lyric pieces

> i did n't like these at first . i based my purchase strictly on the positive reviews , so i was expecting better . however , once i thought about it , i paid 6 bucks for these things . i was practically expecting bose quality sound , which was ridiculous . after i re-evaluated , i realize that for the money , these headphones are actually pretty damn good . they sound good enough , and they 've lasted me a very long time with no issues at all ( knock on wood ) . these are my gym headphones . i actually leave them in the car on my backseat , and just snatch them up before i walk into the gym from my car.all in all , for the price , i 'm not sure you can do any better than these . no , they 're not bose quality , or beats by dre , or anything top of the line , but for the money , it 's 5-star value .

> there 's a war about to break out between two supernatural forces , and our world is the battlefield . the premise might be shopworn , but execution us everything , and this executes beautifully.action moves between realities , with plenty of dark and dangerous magic even in our world . effects really are special , from almost subliminal to dramatic set-pieces - that car/hotel passage , for example , comes off beautifully , but that 's hardly the only sequence worth seeing.if this series of movies follows the books , the twilight watch will come out some time . do n't worry , that wo n't betwilight ( over which i 'm sure lawyers are having conniptions ) . these vampires do n't sparkle - they have more of a russian winter in them than pacific northwest drizzle . daywatch sustained the energy this one carried , and i ca n't wait for more. -- wiredweird

> one of the best parts of this movie is the cinematography which shows breathtaking scenery in canada . another strength is the presence of robert duvall who portrays the boss of 3 other men whose herd of cattle do & quot ; free-range & quot ; grazing , much to the chagrin of the neighboring cattlemen . he and kevin costner have to stand up to the men who oppose them , which leads to the obligatory shoot-out at the end . another subplot is the developing relationship between costner 's character and annette bening who plays the part of the sister of the local doctor who tends to duvall 's men who are wounded by the townspeople . this movie is a welcome throw-back to the old-fashioned western and makes for good viewing despite some stilted dialogue ( & quot ; let 's rustle up some grub. & quot ; )

> great thing about tv episodes on amazon prime is i can watch four of 'em back-to-back , commercial-free and in sparkling high definition and makes it feel like a miniseries or long form theatrical movie.justified has an understated hero who 's a quickdraw dead shot , and you know you want the bad guys to get what 's coming to them . like other fx series ( the shield ) , the dialog is peppered with spicy language you ca n't get on the broadcast networks , so it keeps your attention and makes you want to watch . i hope to be caught up with this fine series by the time the 5th season premieres on fx january 10th . your time watching this show will definitely be justified .

> i usually buy cheaper soaps or use leftover hotel soaps but as soon as the weather got colder i noticed my skin was getting dry and itchy . i immediately looked for a different soap and found tom 's of maine had a great olive oil soap . this soap also has vitamin e in it so it is doubly healing . it has a light fruity fragrance which is not at all offensive and does n't leave your skin scented either . i also find that when using this soap i do n't need as much moisturizer . so even though the soap is a little more expensive than i normally pay i actually feel like i 'm saving money.~the rebecca review

> in this fifth installment of karen hawkins 's series involving the macleans , we meet again alexander maclean , laird of his clan , and caitlyn hurst , the young miss who started all the trouble in the fourth book , sleepless in scotland . alexander is intent on getting his revenge on caitlyn for causing his family embarrassment . he gets caitlyn invited to a house party , specifically for the purpose of ruining her . he figures it wo n't take much to push her impulsive nature into doing something he wo n't regret.caitlyn has promised her mother she will control her temper and be as proper as can be at the house party . but then she discovers alexander maclean is there , too , and all promises become a lot harder to keep . as they goad one another into increasingly daring situations , the flames that were ignited before leap to the fore again . in an attempt at resolving their situation , they agree to complete three tasks based on a myth . but who will be the real winner ? i enjoyed this story of revenge and love , though not as much as the previous installment . alexander is almost hyper-male , though incredibly sexy . his lust for revenge is a bit wearying , but caitlyn is a joy to read as she reacts to his taunts . the heat between them nearly scorches the pages . the laird who loved me is definitely a fine addition to the series.niki leereviewed for joyfully reviewed

> set in the interval between the sinking of the titanic and the outbreak of world war i , this excellent program follows the adventures of the crawley family of downton abbey , their extensive house staff , and various assorted characters that come within their orbit.this is one of those luxurious british dramas that feature palatial estates with cavernous drawing rooms and classy british aristocrats in elegant dress , invariably overseen by some grand dame such as maggie smith , who demonstrates here that her talent is undimmed by age . the main drama for these lords and ladies is the question of what will become of downton abbey and the daughters ( michelle dockery , laura carmichael , and jessica brown findlay ) of robert crawley , the earl of grantham ( hugh bonneville ) , since he has no male heir to claim the estate after his death . there is also much drama among the serving staff , who receives as much screen time as their masters . one of the most interesting aspects is the depiction of the close , mutually respectful relationships that often develop between the family and the staff . intrigue , secrets and betrayals abound , and the greatest flaw with this production is that the plotting often seems a bit too neat and tidy , in the tradition of american prime time soap operas . despite that , this program consistently entertains and the fine ensemble cast provides too many excellent performances to single anyone out in a brief review .

> re-reading these books . i can somewhat remember reading all of these books . of course , i can not forget about flowers in the attic . so it was a great victory when cathy , christopher , and carrie escaped their grandmother 's attic . i was excited to join them on their journey to sunny florida . that did not happen . they end up in south carolina . i was actually kind of disappointed that they did not truly escape . i mean they did from their evil grandmother and mother but it seemed that the doctor that cathy , christopher , and carrie stayed with was almost as bad.i know cathy wanted to believe that she is nothing like her mother but she did not try very hard to prove she is not like her . she played with the men she came across like her mother . she did not care who 's feelings she hurt . cathy got on my nerves . i could not feel sorry for christopher as he was also obsessed with his sister still . the one i felt sorry for was carrie . she did not really have any one left after her twin , cory died . the first half of the book , i flew through . i then put the book down for a while and when i picked it back up , i was only semi into it again . however this is still a interesting series to read .

> it ai n't easy being green , and on vivian 's second album , she takes us through a rollercoaster ride of many moods and emotions . she leans away from her so-called nu soul roots and dabbles a bit with radio r & b , but does this mean she 's sold out ? i 'd hesitate to rush to that judgement , but `` vivian '' is solid enough to make it a worthy followup . `` under my skin '' and `` frustrated '' are title-says-it-all jams that explore the turbulent nature of relationships , and the same can be said for the single `` got ta go got ta leave ( tired ) '' and the opener `` wish we could go back . '' but it ai n't all gloom and doom . the mood does perk up on more upbeat tracks on `` sweet thing '' and `` all about us . '' but the album 's most impressive quality is vivian 's voice , which is strong enough to redeem the album 's sometimes-trite lyrics . still , in an age where vapid , video artist beauties are the norm , `` vivian '' is a nice alternative . go check it out .

> i really , really love this little hipe motion-sensing light . i keep it in the hallway near my children 's room . they do n't have a light switch there , and this gives them enough light to walk to the restroom at night without tripping over things or bumping into walls.installation was easy . in fact , it 's so clever , i think it could be used for so many other applications . there 's a little metal disc that we tape ( with provided adhesive disc ) or screw into the wall . i screwed it in . the light mounts magnetically onto that disc . i love it ! the light bar swivels , up and down . i like to aim it towards the floor . of course , it could swivel back and forth if the light is rotated vertically -- and it can be rotated to any angle on that magnetic mount.the motion sensor always triggers when i walk past and the output is just right for a hallway nightlight . i have three motion-sensing lights around the house and this one 's my favorite.this product was provided for review by c & a marketing .

> i like most things about the kindle touch , so i 'm going to quickly run through the things that knocked it down from 5 stars to 4. first , the black screen flash when changing pages can get quite annoying . it 's not the worst thing ever , but if an update could get rid of it , that would be much appreciated . second , the navigation is not the most intuitive . it 's easy to mix up the screen zones ( i suspect even the os does that sometimes ) , and the home button does n't do some of the things i feel like it should do . third , you ca n't get wireless delivery of overdrive books . there has to be a way to make that happen ; it ca n't be a technological impossibility.the best part is the e-ink display . i tried reading books on my ipad , and it both burned through the battery like nobody 's business and gave me a headache . this has neither of those problems .

> prophets of doom have always made entertaining reading . in his latest fire-and-brimstone warning , robert r. prechter , jr. , an experienced forecaster of long-term economic and social trends , says financial armageddon is just around the corner . while his technical analysis ( `` wave theory '' ) may appear to be stock-market astrology , readers may appreciate his examination of the basic functions of money and credit , his argument that worldwide central banking has fundamentally altered these functions , and his perceptive comparisons of the late 1990s with the roaring twenties . prechter might have appealed to a broader audience by toning down his graphs and technical talk , and focusing instead on his investment suggestions : if the market turns down , you 'll save your skin , but even in a bull market , keeping your money safe ca n't hurt . we recommend this book to anyone looking for bear-market investment advice , as well as those interested in technical analysis or an opinionated view of business and market cycles .

> the keep is important to the third reich . so when german soldiers stationed there start to die the ss is sent to investigate and destroy whatever enemy they find.but what happens when the enemy is more powerful , more ruthless and even more sadistic than the death squads sent to fight it ? the story started out very strong , a mixture of horror , mystery and even a touch historical novel . the characters seemed real , the plot solid and the flow was smooth . the fears that theodor cuza develops about his religion and his faith , the interplay between erich kaempffer 's naked greed and klaus woermann 's military professionalism , only add to the reality of the setting.but near the end the story started to get a little too wild , turning from a vampire/between a rock and a hard place/lovecraft book into something more fitting of fantasy/evil vs. good/e.e. & quot ; doc & quot ; smith book .

> these are good sticky notes and do the job well . being anal retentive on some things , i like the fact there are differing colors to signify different things while reviewing a lengthy document - in my case , a color for a different person 's attention as well as a color for something that needs attention fast . i also like the fact they can be taken off and reapplied several times before the `` sticky '' goes away - that will save you on purchasing new boxes of these things.about the only improvement suggestion i have is i do n't like the thin and small feature of the base - i wish i could get something a little more sturdy as the base tends to slide around on my desk when trying to grab one one-handed . if that 's my only `` negative , '' things are going well with this product .

> a very interesting cartoon . very different . i think it 's great that disney brought this cartoon from japan to share with us to show how cartoons and cultures can be very different . anyone with a strong interest in japan and japanese culture must get it.it 's about a colony of raccoons facing the loss of their habitat when human beings come to develop it . but more so than that , it 's about japanese culture and traditions . very funny , amusing , lovingly drawn and well translated into english . it 's just so different from a cultural point of view that the first few minutes were a culture shock , but very enjoyable . highly recommended , but maybe not for small children since it talks about death . if this for young kids , make sure the parents are there to explain the movie .

> this non-greasy lotion is a very basic lotion i would recommend under foundation . it contains no sunblock ( which would give this lotion a more sticky feel ) but it does contain vitamins b5 and e. it also contains glycerin which skin does absorb , and borage seed oil , but it also contains mineral oil as its fourth ingredient , and mineral oil coats the skins rather than gets absorbed by it . it absorbs well into the skin but it does n't give my skin that just-moisturized feel like more expensive lotions do.while the box says this is 12-hour lotion , i have to apply it three times a day , but that may be due to living in a dry climate.for the price this is decent moisturizer .

> the title track sets the tone as one of reflection on days gone by . this mellow mid-tempo number with intricate instrumental flourishes is followed by the buoyant love song meet me in the indian summer.steal my heart away is also a love song , but more soulful with evocative imagery , hey mr dj is a chugging pop number with lovely backing vocals and a bit of morrison 's wordless vocalising , whilst talk is cheap is a slow bluesy track about the pitfalls of fame.the tuneful ballad what makes the irish heart beat is a definite highlight of the album , infused with celtic soul . all work and no play is a pleasant enough pop ditty and the next one , whatever happened to pj proby is really interesting as he references various obscure british singers from the 1960s.one of my favourites is the stirring nostalgic ballad the beauty of the days gone by with its gorgeous melody and poetic lyrics . i also love the tuneful and lilting only a dream . the last song , fast train with its appealing organ and harmonica made me think of arlo guthrie 's last train , but is nowhere near as heart-breaking and intense . and that is what i miss on this album : van 's intensely devotional moments.down the road displays all the various styles of the artist , like r & b , rock and his irish soulfulness but sticks mostly to the middle of the road . the songs are mostly good and sometimes great as in the aforementioned tracks . down the road is really a 5-star album , but measured against van morrison 's vast body of musical genius , it comes in at four .

> this story is about teenagers so keep that in mind when reading this book as i have seen a lot of people not notice this when buying this book . if you are like me and teenage love stories annoy , bore you or both i would not recommend this . however if you find them sweet and love a perfect romance story with twist that all turns out wonderful in the end you will love this book.hopeless was super predictable , i knew the plot aside from ****spoiller sky being kidnapped ***spoiler*** from very , very early on . i mean like the first 50 pages early on and yes i was dead on because really the author seems to almost be begging you to figure it out.sky and holder were both super annoying at times and there is one dry humping scene that really turned me off but there were some parts of the book that were not so bad.the first half of the book was really , really boring . to be honest i have no idea why six was even needed ? she could have been left out of all the book and you would not have missed her for a second.i can see why teenagers would fall in love with this book but not me . it was simple , a simple fast read that wo n't challenge your way of thinking or your mind . not all together a bad thing but with the subject matter this covers you can do better . not geared towards adults tho ! this is very much geared towards ya crowd so keep that in mind when buying this !

> king tirian of narnia is thrilled to hear the rumors that , after a couple hundred years of silence , aslan has returned to the country . but when he goes to investigate himself , he discovers that no one is allowed to see the lion . in fact , an ape is speaking for him . the new pronouncements are just as puzzling , including the enslavement of the talking animals . what is going on ? his few allies include eustace and jill from our own world . but can they defeat this new evil ? this book is different from others in the series because the story starts in narnia and then brings the characters from our world into theirs . but the differences do n't stop there . this is a stirring conclusion of a great series . the symbolism is strong , and i find this book one of the most interesting of the series from that standpoint . the story is probably one of the fastest in the series , with so much intrigue and fighting going on , it 's hard to put down , even on a reread . the ending leaves me with a feeling of euphoria mixed with just a little bit of melancholy because the series is over.while the order the other books in the series are read does n't matter as much , this one must be read at the end to fully appreciate it . it 's a wonderful ending to a wonderful series . do n't miss it .

> mrs. spudman and i think very highly of this mira brand set of stainless steel storage containers . we no longer have youngsters at home , so i use the containers to bring snacks or leftovers to work . occasionally we use them to store leftovers to heat up for lunch the following day . as i write this tomorrow 's lunch is in the fridge stored in the middle size container.i like that no chemicals leach into the food with these stainless steel containers . plastic containers soon become pitted or stained . since i seldom put plastic containers in the microwave for reheating , having metal containers is no problem for me . in fact , for cold foods , like fruit , i think the steel keeps the food cooler than a plastic container does.the lids are very secure on these containers . i sometimes drop my lunch bag at work , and a lid has never come off during a break . a tight fitting lid is also important for transporting any type of food with liquid content . the mira containers allow you not to worry about any inconvenient , messy spills.bottom line - yes , these are not low priced containers , but they are attractive , sturdy , and reliable . i 'm guessing their longevity of the containers will end up being quite impressive , outlasting many of their plastic companions .

> long before tommy bolin joined deep purple in the mid-70s , he was on this album . zephyr 's self-titled debut was released by abc probe -- the labals underground branch , -in 1969.this is a blues rock album but is progressive blues . the first track features a long keybord rave up , frothing with energy . a lot of bands felt obligated to put such ideas in their work in 1969 , but zephyr are great players , and make this idea pay off.the album continues with such mixes and is a great listen for late 1960s rock with some progressive elements.candy givens is not a terrible singer -- the band are big enough to sustain her vocals . she is good in the lower ranges , but her voice is a grating instrument in the higher ones . every women in hard rock was trying to sing like janis joplin in 1969 , and if you ever doubt there was only one janis , take a listen to given 's attempts to make that two.still , this is more than engaging enough to hold the attention and is a great little known album from the era . if they had gotten a better vocalist , they might have been bigger .

> this items costs a fraction of what nikon charges for its hb-45 lens hood.it works just fine . it has a very snug fit and is difficult to take off the lens - but that is also true for the genuine nikon hb-45 . the real thing is made of a somewhat flexible material , while the hb-45 ii ( that 's what they call it ) is somewhat more rigid , which i think might not work out to well in case of major impact . but i also suspect any impact severe enough to break the hb-45 ii is likely to damage your lens and camera as well.unlike the nikon hb-45 , the hb-45 ii has a butterfly shape . only time and intensive use will tell whether or not this is as effective as the solid side of the nikon hb-45 . if nothing else , careful positioning of the hb-45 ii may reduce the shadow problems created when using the internal flash and the hb-45 hood.on the whole , this is an excellent value.on a side note , the manufacturer very closely copies the hb-45 identification . the nikon logotype is closely copied . i wonder if these folks will get a letter from nikon about that ? jerry

> i avoided this book for a long time , dismissing it as just ( overwrought ) young adult fiction . what a mistake . hunger games is a compulsive , edge-of-the-seat , what will happen next read.i could not put this novel aside . katniss everdean represents her hometown district in the annual hunger games , wherein she must fight to the death for pure entertainment value . she is an interesting character , a capable , tough girl , not willing to be a tool for the government . but she is also a teenage girl , caught in the angst of her emotions and she is cleary drawn to two boys , one from her district and one from the hunger games.at times the story slowed down as katniss explored and tried to reconcile her feeling ; hence 4 out of 5 stars . other times , the story propelled forward as the action in the arena unfolded . suzanne collins is a master at suspension . i literally could not put this book down until i was done . a great read .

> the exceptional grandness and the singularity of his genius resides in that unique approach dressed with mythical breath , which origins hi westerns remains in our memory with such intensity level . he knew as any other filmmaker the western constitutes the true american mythology , and that is why his characters are always depicted with this certain mystery 's aura . they do not seem to obey exactly the rules of the establishment , but seem to merge with the inner passion and natural commitment , that in certain moments may agree with the state of things but not always fit ; there is something out of context in their attitudes . they fight following their own codes.this is a clear example : fonda like icarus decides to confront the apaches , despite john wayne 's wisdom so typical of athena 's prudence who advises not to make it ; once more face the mature wisdom and the irreverent epic mood , which eventually will clash with the expected consequences.an admirable saga and the first part of his trilogy .

> i was nervous purchasing this because the bad reviews are bad but i 've had it for 2 months and it has never disappointed . as far as i know , it has dropped signal a total of one time and only for about 30 seconds . i have never had to reset it . i sincerely have no idea how i ever lived without it . i have 4 devices constantly using it ( laptop , ipad , blu ray for netflix , and phone ) and the speed is amazing on every device , it keeps a strong secure connection and the unit itself is very well made and easily worth the price . the blue lights did annoy me but now i just keep it turned over and it 's fine . i do occasionally check to make sure the security settings are in place because i 'm just not down to share my sweet wifi with peeps and it has always been secured . setup was easy , maybe 10 minutes

> what does lincoln do at gettysburg ? why are his words as moving today as they were when he uttered them ? i think that what he did is that he defined for america and americans what it is , and what it means to be to itself . he did this in the most dignified and moving language imaginable with its deep biblical cadences and its underlying tone of grief and dedication . he invokes the 'brave men living and dead'the heroic sacrifice of the war in order to urge a new dedication of freedom a new and higher realization of that fundamental human value which is so closely connected with the whole american enterprise . he defines not simply for those there , for those on that field the living and the dead , but for all american generations a ' new birth of freedom , so that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from this earth ``

> i enjoyed reading swain 's tony valentine gambling-themed novels , but this time he switches characters and styles , trying for more of hard-edged private eye tale . the positive blurb ( `` a nonstop nail-biter ... . hero jack carpenter is one for the ages '' ) on the cover by lee child ( whose jack reacher books i love ) intrigued me enough to buy this one , but i was very disappointed . too much of this novel was riddled with clich & eacute ; d characters , weak dialogue and just plain silly scenarios . it had an interesting premise and the potential to be a good book , but it fell flat in my estimation . it seemed like this novel was something swain wrote too quickly , and was not edited very well either . needless to say , this is a series that i wo n't be following .

> wow . i liked laura branigan back in the 1980s , when she was at the top of her career , and i never stopped liking her music . this wonderful `` best of '' album contains a lot of great laura branigan tunes - solitaire , power of love , self control , and others . my favorite is how can i help you say goodbye.this is a great album , one that is a lot of fun to listen to . unlike with some artists , there is no one `` sound '' - you know , where all of their tunes sound basically alike . i really enjoy this album and highly recommend it !

> melissa and doug puzzles are generally a good buy with big sturdy pieces and bright colors . this puzzle is no different.the pieces are big enough for little fingers to hold and manipulate . the pieces are durable and have put with with three children putting this puzzle together and pulling it apart repeatedly . the colors are bright.the bright yellow line going down the side of the fire truck is what makes it easy enough for children as young as four ( and a little bit younger ) able to put it together.this is a great puzzle.enjoy .

> deodato scored with a jazzy version of & quot ; also sprach zarathustra , & quot ; but it is not the song from & quot ; 2001 & quot ; that makes this album a must-have . cut five ( & quot ; prelude to the afternoon of a faun & quot ; ) is such a passionate and powerful work that it overshadows every other selection on this truly exceptional disc . it is obvious that the artist was eons ahead of his contemporaries as well as his successors .

> the ugly duchess by eloisa james is an interesting regency historical romance . it is book # 4 in the `` fairy tales '' series , but can be read as a stand alone . see , `` a kiss at midnight '' , '' when beauty tamed the beast '' , and `` the duke is mine '' . while , i have enjoyed this series , `` the ugly duchess '' is not my favorite . it is a remake of `` the ugly duckling '' fairy tale with a twist . this is the tale of theodora saxby , society outcast and named `` the ugly duchess '' after her marriage to the handsome , heir to the duchy of ashbrook , james ryburn.best friends and raised as sibling until james ' does the unthinkable , than james must step in and save the day . after only two days of wedded bliss , theodora over hears the truth of her wedding . james , disappears and becomes a pirate . after seven years of separation , theo is ready to have james declared dead . james must win theo 's heart again and the two of then soon learn that all fair in love . `` the ugly duchess '' gives insight into how a few spoken words can harm a person 's ego , damage their heart , and hurt their self respect . a powerful story , but has little of none of ms. james ' usual witty banter . received for an honest review from the publisher and above the treeline . details can be found at the author 's website , avon books , an imprint of harper collins publishing group and my book addiction and more.rating : 4heat rating : mildreviewed by : aprilr , my book addiction and more/my book addiction reviews

> while i foundstorm front ( the dresden files , book 1 ) andfool moon ( the dresden files , book 2 ) perfectly enjoyable , i had n't yet decided whether the dresden files series would be on my `` must read '' list . i was hooked enough to give grave peril a try , and i 'm sure glad i did ! grave peril puts less emphasis on the whole wizard-for-hire angle . instead of responding to some random paranormal event , this time our hapless hero is being actively targeted by some big league bad guys . and unlike fool moon , which focused on one specific brand of supernatural foe , grave peril is absolutely packed with interesting characters , including vampires , a dragon , a holy knight , a body-snatching ghost , and harry 's faerie godmother ! i have n't seen a cast like this since the crimson series of graphic novels ( which every dresden fan would do well to check out ) .the events in grave peril put harry to the ultimate test , and not everyone walks away from this one unscathed . harry 's confrontations , particularly with the various members of the vampire courts as well as with his godmother , are the stuff of legends , and the way they are written is very cinematic . you can see these epic events unfold in your mind.butcher took the series to the next level with this book ; giving readers a much better look at what makes harry tick and introducing several supporting characters who are almost as interesting as harry himself . i only hope this is n't the last we 've seen of them .
= keeps getting better !

> this is a great tool to have when cutting large sheets of plywood or drywall to maintain a straight edge . it also offers the ability to use it as a clamp for edge gluing as a replacement for a traditional pipe clamp.the build quality is decent . i would not consider this to be `` contractor grade '' in that i do n't think it would withstand heavy-duty use for an extended period , but it 's more than solid enough for homeowner use.the problems i have are twofold . first , the clamp end can be a bit fussy with regard to positioning . the travel is not all that smooth , and the clamp end can take a bit of fiddling with to get it to move . not a big deal , however.what is more problematic is the fact that the edge stops ( the parts that grip the sheet ) pivot . while the manufacturer highlights this as a feature for angled cuts , it also makes it hard to ensure the line is square . you have to use a square to check that the guide is positioned at 90 degrees . a better design would be edge guides that either were fixed in place ( which would eliminate angled cuts ) or guides that had a click-stop at 90 degrees.still , it remains a really helpful tool to have , especially with drywall . having it made making long cuts much easier and quicker , and i would certainly recommend it ( with the two caveats above ) .
= bit finicky , but a helpful tool to have
< great for drywall and drywall

> a time travelling serial killer identifies his victims as children . her returns to kill them when they are adults , leaving behind a strange memento from the future . troubled kirby is the one that got away . feisty and sarcastic , she interns at a chicago newspaper . assigned to a burnt out crime reporter cum sports reporter , she embarks on an investigation that will have her questioning her sanity and fighting for her life.this is an imperfect novel that requires suspension of belief . the portal for the time travel was intriguing . i found the book choppy and confusing at times . it leaps from character to character and time to time . this dissipates the tension and other than a series of brutal murders , you never get to know or get involved with most of the victims . kirby is abrasive and not terribly engaging . the love story is never developed and her relationship with her flakey mother is off putting . the killer is the run of the mill psychopath . he is attracted to certain girls because they shine . whether he perceives something in their energy or light force or whether this is a figment of his imagination is never explained . his backstory is limited and frankly , he is not all that interesting . still this is an entertaining exercise with an imaginative twist on a fairly routine serial killer tale . recommended .

> what drew me originally to this product was its multifunctional nature . you get the moisturizer with a tint that protects from sun damage while preventing aging . smart to have all in one package , you 'd think.alas , this may be one of those cases where one might just prefer having the separate products.not to say this does n't work . it provides plenty of moisture . i trust its sunscreen qualities . the color is nice -- enough to give tint but light enough to work over a good spectrum of `` tan '' . granted , the anti-aging is definitely something that will take awhile to test , but all the necessities seem to be in order for it to do its job.so why am i complaining ? i do n't like putting this stuff on . it 's incredibly thick and heavy , no doubt the result of all the aforementioned nice qualities . my face does n't feel greasy , per say , but there 's definitely a constant reminder there is something on my face and it 's difficult to adjust amount for color.three stars because yes , i believe , the product does what it sets out to do . but only three stars as it 's just not pleasant for me . i 'll stick to separate products , thank-you .

> when i bought this book earlier there was only the one bad review but for some strange reason i decided to buy it after reading the sample chapters . i 've come across this author a few times before but have been hesitant to buy any of her books because of the mixed reviews . i think what probably pushed me into finally going for it is that i 'm a sucker for stories about dukes.i did n't have any preconceived ideas because i had n't read any of the other books in the series , which seems to be a problem for some of the other reviewers . i liked the fact that the h gave the h a run for his money and did n't just sigh and give in to him . the story kept me enthralled from start to finish and it 's just after 2 am in the morning here ! i realise that for some the love story came quickly but i found it believable when you read the ending . anyway i recommend this book and now i 'm going to go back and read some of the others .

> i buy a lot of movies off the dvd bargain rack at a nearby ross store . one latest such bargain was a collection of four whoopi goldberg movies . the two dvds were double sided with a movie on each side . they worked fine , but you have to be careful of getting fingerprints on them.in any case , all the movies in this set were enjoyable feel-good stories with happy endings . of course , they were humorous from place to place . my top favorites were `` corrina , corrina '' and `` made in america , '' but the other two were not far behind . all were well done in the moviemaking ways . i reviewed each movie under the separate titles and my intent here is to review the package . whoopi goldberg is one of those hollywood stars that has a large enthusiastic fan base and , if you 're one of them , you 'd like this package of dvds . however , they 're rather lightweight as movies go and if you 're looking for something more serious , i 'd look elsewhere.gary peterson

> i was never a big fan of the muppets , but this movie is special . it gives a nostalgic vibe and an ultimate comeback for the muppets . i loved the references they made to their tv show , and their previous movies . the jokes were hilarious . the musical numbers were decent . while growing up , gary and walter ( who is actually a muppet himself ) become obsessed with the muppets show . gary plans a hollywood anniversary vacation for his girlfriend , mary , but walter comes along too to see the muppet theater . when he hears that tex richman plans to destroy the theater for oil , walter tracks down each of the muppets to help raise $ 10,000,00 to save the theater and put on the ultimate muppet show . join kermit , miss piggy , fozzie , gonzo , animal , rowlf , swedish chef , rizzo , and the rest for the biggest comeback in muppet history . if you grew up with the show , you 'll definitely love the muppets ! ! !

> i started to read `` heart of the warrior '' thinking it might be an interesting read . little did i realize this was /not/ a stand alone book . after the first promising chapter staring a 30 yr old virgin ( hmmmm ) , we progressed on to the sf portion of the book with the hero named dalden.soon , i was overwhelmed with sci-fi jargon and long interludes featuring characters from other books . this would be fine if kept to a minimum . unfortunately , it was n't . since i have never read the other books i have no clue who challen or his lifemate are ... and did n't particularly care , i quickly lost interest . this seemed more like a 'reunion ' book than a romance.perhaps this book might be good for those who 've read the others in the series and want to find out what 'happened ' to the other characters . for someone new to the series , i just could n't grasp it , and this quickly became a wall-banger .
= warning ... .this book is a sequel

> many americans recognize the name bill o'reilly who faithfully engages both the sympathetic and the skeptical on his weekday television show , the o'reilly factor.o'reilly teams up with historian , martin dugard in a work of historical fiction - killing lincoln . the authors succeed in presenting readers with an account of the events leading up to the assassination of americas beloved 16th president.o'reilly and dugard set the context by alerting readers to the events that surround the civil war . they introduce the key players and pay close attention to general ulysses grant and his close friendship with lincoln . the grizzly portrait of john wilkes booth is carefully painted and the monsters who conspired with booth are introduced.the most compelling feature of killing lincoln is the man himself . one gets a sense of his love for liberty , passion for civil rights , and his natural propensity to lead . killing lincoln is a stark reminder of the freedom that americans enjoy - a freedom that is eroding by the day .

> listen to the opening lines of `` the loved ones '' and you hear costello at his best . snappy lines , sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit . then we hit the piano `` noodling '' and the song starts to drift away from me . the cd is filled with moments like this ; great lyrics and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornments . stripped down , this is some of costello 's best stuff ; songs that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect . but every time i feel like i get close to the heart of the song , i feel lost in the middle of music that serves no purpose . this is definitely worth a listen and i still enjoy popping it in the machine , but i feel some of his other works is more deserving of the high praise given imperial bedroom .

> i have to say in all areas the box is nicer than this watch . it 's way too large on my 6 '' wrist and there is no way to adjust it as the band is one stinky silicone band . most of the time i ca n't even get the time to activate despite pressing on the side mode botton , so i do n't even see the benefit of `` checking time '' quickly from this watch.the design is nice , very slick-looking and perhaps designed for an underwater diver , but in the office or on terra firma the band attracts a lot of dust , making this charcoal grey watch very ugly looking . for me and my needs , it will go back inside the box .

> like frankenstein 's monster this has become a classic of early sci fi horror films . the early time lapse special effects of the transformation in the spencer tracy character makes the film historically important in technical terms as well . the acting is first rate and the plot although not exactly the novel is closer than a lot of others since.the idea that chemical imbalances in the brain governbehavior has been part of drug treatment for different types of dementiasince even before this was written in the 19th century.we have seen that drugs are not an answer in the 20th century .

> in a way , & quot ; heathen chemistry & quot ; , oasis ' 5th studio album ( not counting the superb & quot ; the masterplan & quot ; compilation of b sides ) , is undone by the great single & quot ; the hindu times & quot ; , released 3 months ago , and creating great expectations . i ended my review of the single by writing that this album would confirm if oasis is & quot ; really , truly back in the saddle & quot ; . we have the answer now , and regretfully it is a clear & quot ; no & quot ; . & quot ; heathen chemistry & quot ; is book-ended with high-energy tracks & quot ; hindu times & quot ; ( to start ) and & quot ; better man & quot ; ( to end ) . the 9 tracks in between are a very mixed bag , with simply too much mediocrity , certainly compared to the & quot ; definitely maybe & quot ; and & quot ; morning glory & quot ; albums . surprisingly , liam contributes 3 good tracks , the sweet & quot ; songbird & quot ; , the epic & quot ; born on a different cloud & quot ; and the earlier-mentioned & quot ; better man & quot ; . gem archer and andy bell each contribute one song , both just filler.so what is the problem with noel ? he contributes a mere 6 songs , none of which are truly classic , the exception being & quot ; hindu times & quot ; . could it be that his muse simply has left him ? in the years 1994-1996 , great songs came out of noel like water out of a faucet . can somebody turn his inspiration on again ? this is not a bad album , but it 's certainly not a great album , not better than & quot ; standing on the shoulder & quot ; . anyone new to oasis should not buy this album , but instead stick with & quot ; definitely maybe & quot ; and & quot ; morning glory & quot ; . for the dedicated oasis fan , this is a necessary but disappointing addition to the catalogue.ps there is a & quot ; hidden & quot ; track , 30 min . after & quot ; better man & quot ; , a 4 min . lazy instrumental that begs the question ... why ?

> first off , if you are expecting to really get some good informative information about how to write your first screen play for the big screen , then you probably will get your hopes let down with this book . not to say that mr. garant and mr. lennon did not provide the reader with some good street smarts and lessons that they have learned in only a way that mr. garant and mr. lennon can do . while , i did enjoy mr. garant and mr. lennon 's let it all hang out their sense of humor and say anything attitude in this book , i was expecting to laugh until tears came out but this did not happen . instead , i read about the first half of this book and then just skimmed the rest of it.it is understandable how their television show reno 911 became as sucessful as it was and some of their movies as well . of course , after reading this book , you can not really blame them for herbie : fully loaded . i am sure what they original wrote was good but after all the other screen writers got their hands on the script , including the director and horrible actor ( she who shall not be named but is still alive and not dead ) . the movie just ended up being a big flop.\important tips you can take away from this book is ... do n't bank on just one script , have several . have a good entertainment lawyer , dress to impress , pimp your movie , write your script with a big movie star in mind to play the starring role as they will help to make your dreams come true . because once you have made it , then you will score the best parking spots at all the major studios .

> two chinese lovers drift around buenos aires , attempting to come to grips with a relationship that is clearly on the skids in this interesting and frustrating film ` cheun gwong tsa sit ' ( happy together ) by the very talented kar wai wong . on vacation from hong kong , yiu-fai ( tony leung ) and po-wing ( leslie cheung ) are presented in an obviously unhappy state , but we are not privy to the cause of their unhappiness . yes , there is infidelity , there are outside attractions , and all of the ` things ' that could create this state , but we are left to look at this sad young couple as a metaphor for the struggles in emotions and loves that so often surface in a dying relationship , not only in the gay relationship we are seeing but in straight relationships as well . the universals hold true.kar wai wong loves the non-linear approach to story telling and in this early film the method of his direction feels a bit too disjointed , too uninvolved in the character development . not that the actors do not render fine performances : both leung and cheung give brave portrayals of lost souls and we can not help but care for both of them . and the remainder of the cast is on target ( chen chang and gregory dayton ) .what holds the little hints of greatness that were to come ( this film dates back to 1997 ) is suggested in the lighting and camera work , both of which provide as major a role in the film as the actors and chaotic storyline . the unity of mood and story is solidly at one in this little film , showing us just how creative the writer director was to become . grady harp , august 06

> let me start by saying that new order was one of the very best rock bands of the 1980s , and certainly the best synthesizer dominated rock band ever . unfortunately , since that decade ended they have sort of floundered in the wilderness . their last cd of original material , 1993 's & quot ; republic & quot ; was regrettably mediocre . since then , a half-coherent best of album and a lot of solo projects are all that have been seen of them . until & quot ; get ready , & quot ; their official reunion.things look promising enough . the cover art is typical in that it is perfectly enigmatic , and features the band 's name nowhere upon it . the music has that signature new order synthesizer style and the production is crisp and confident . unfortunately , the songwriting , while not awful , lacks the distinctiveness that marks the best of the band 's recorded efforts . there are a number of guest appearances , most notably lead smashing pumpkin billy corgan , but they do n't seem to have added much in the way of inspiration.overall , & quot ; get ready & quot ; is n't a bad album . there are no truly lousy tracks and the whole thing has a uniform consistency to it . it just wo n't transport you back to the dance floor , circa 1987 .

> rhino 's re-release of this classic set is an excellent repackaging of this classic cd . uncle tupelo 's sound of alternative country sounds amazingly fresh with rhino 's remastering magic . the bonus tracks on the new issue are of interest to long-time band fans . `` stay true '' is a blast of jay farrar 's guitar & vocals . jeff tweedy takes lead vocals on `` wherever '' with a minimalist melody , `` hey what 's that mean ? do n't make it sound so simple . '' `` are you sure hank done it this way ? '' is a strong waylon jennings-penned country rocker . the live hoedown version of `` truck drivin ' man '' has great tasty fiddle . my favorite ear candy is ut 's blow-out version of the classic rocker `` suzy q '' recorded live at the vic theatre in chicago . the guys rock maliciously on this 7-minute track . of the original tracks , `` the long cut '' is a delightful rocker with jeff 's ragged vocals fitting the material like a glove . `` steal the crumbs '' has a good build and one of those neil young-inspired vocals . `` anodyne '' has long been recognized for its creative brilliance and originality . rhino 's re-issue offers a great booklet with lyrics and commentary on the band and this set . enjoy !

> kirk was bound to meet khan at some point in the new movies . i must admit i was slighty disappointed . the reason is i did n't feel the same tension between them nor does khan 's group of engineered superhumans play as key a factor . that said it is still a very entertaining movie so i only subtracted one star . if you enjoyed the first of the new star trek movies , you will probably enjoy this one as well . all the key characters are back and for the most part doing what you 'd expect . two exceptions , one is some explanation on some things that puzzled us in the tv series ( section 31 , etc . ) , and scotty gets in a snoot over weapons he does n't have the specs on being brought aboard the enterprise . so much so he leaves , but do n't count him out . you know scotty , he works miracles . well worth a rental . i bought the amazon instant version so i could see it before the dvd release . my wife and i watched it twice over the weekend.recommendations : star trek ( 2009 ) , space seed [ hd ] , andstar trek ii : the wrath of khanca luster

> john keegan has produced a masterful one-volume history of the iraq war . he begins with a history of the region and iraq and the peculiar political and religious currents that have formed the peoples of the area . next he covers the transition of european thinking that has led to so many contemporary tragedies like rwanda and the stagnation of the un . keegan pays particular attention to the french and jacques chirac . it is no surprise that chirac fought so tenaciously to keep saddam and the ba'ath party in power.next keegan details in brief the preparations for war and the campaign itself . his treatment is simply superb . he encapsulates all the notable military activity into barely 100 pages . finally keegan provides an overview of what went wrong with the post-war administration by garner and bremmer.overall , & quot ; the iraq war & quot ; is , in my opinion , a masterpiece . it puts all the essential facts necessary for a balanced understanding of the conflict into a single , slim volume.how i wish people would read this before opining , particularly critics of the war.jerry

> too many films depend on special effects alone to drive their film . it 's that rare bird , martin scorsese 's `` hugo '' comes to mind , where the effects are there to enhance the story . `` life of pi '' joins that select company . what director ang lee has devised here is nothing short of a miracle . you will find yourself transfixed by this tale of young pi patel ( suraj sharma ) cast adrift in the ocean after the freighter carrying he , his family , and a menagerie of zoo animals capsizes . this film is a testament to will , determination , and faith that keeps pi alive to survive his ordeal . much has been said about ang lee 's direction and there 's no diminishing that but i felt that sharma to be the driving force of the film . this is a case of a director and an actor working in communion to make something of lasting impact . there are no adjectives that can sufficiently describe what a wonder this film is .

> if you like dogfights , you 'll find plenty of it in `` rogue squadron . '' unfortunately , there 's not much else . new characters are introduced left and right with no time for character development . the warm bond they formed with each other was anything but for the reader . i could n't share the moment with them . i hardly knew them.military tactics and strategy were also missing . this story is told from corran horn 's perspective , and the squadron was kept in the dark most of the time . although we are privy to more than he is , it 's not much more . what we did see did not feel like genius to me . i sometimes wondered what in the worlds they were thinking.i leave the story feeling a little empty inside . everyone tells me the series takes off from here . i can only hope .

> i loved everything about this movie . it was n't a thriller , or a mystery , or a sexy comedy . it was a movie about life - enjoying it , savoring it , fearing the end of it , recalling the good and bad times . it is a reminder to younger people that when a person is 40 or 50 or 60 or more , our feelings and ideas do n't stop . we still want love and affection . and in our minds we are still 20 years old , in love , with our whole lives ahead of us . it is as much a shock to us as to the young people in our lives when we look in a mirror and see the wrinkles and grey hair our experiences have given us.the casting was perfect on the movie and it touched my heart .

> the first phone call from heaven is rich with sentimentality . mitch albom hit every button i have to evoke such a wonderful reading experience -- this book will stay with me forever . right now , one of the tests i have for a book touching on this subject matter is wether or not it is worthy of purchasing extra copies for friends and family who suffered the loss of our dearest friend . this book has most definitely made that list , and i am purchasing several copies as gifts . the first phone call from heaven may be a novel , but it contains more spirtual and heart-felt truth than any well-documented research ever could . do n't miss this book !

> two years ago , kate russell moved to rural carystown , kentucky , aiming to build a new life for herself , and reticent about her past . recently her sleep has been interrupted by dreams in which a little girl , isabella moon , beckons her into the night . isabella disappeared some time ago , and her fate has never been discovered , which sticks in the craw of sheriff delaney . when kate 's dreams indicate where to find isabella 's body , she feels it 's her duty to inform him . he knows better than to take fanciful reports seriously , but his suspicions are raised about kate herself . if kate has her own secrets , so do half the people in town , and before isabella 's mystery is solved , the sheriff will be appalled by what 's been going on under his very nose.in spite of its spooky opening , isabella moon is slow to take off . told in the third person from multiple perspectives , it takes a while to come to know the major players . i nearly gave up on the book . but the lives of carystown folk have been intertwined for generations , and their back stories are important . things finally take wing about a third of the way through , twisting into a dark , rich , peyton place sort of puzzle , with gothic undertones and a sprinkling of the supernatural . this is a character driven novel , all of them vivid and memorable . as for the ending , it 's pretty creepy ; a bit too ambiguous for my taste , but it certainly is in keeping with the rest of the picture . for a debut novel , isabella moon is first rate .

> this was my first e-reader . for years , i 've been reading the tiny little screen of my iphone . i was mostly happy using the kindle app on my phone because i always have it with me . it 's easy to whip out when i find myself in boring meetings or waiting in doctor 's offices . i do most of my reading in bed at night in the dark , so i never considered buying an e-reader . i was not interested in spending money on that type of device and then having to use a book light or an expensive lit case.i recently purchased a kindle fire for my daughter and i was amazed at the ease of shopping for books with that device . i also liked the size and weight for reading . i have an ipad , so i have no need for another tablet , thus i considered the e-reader . the paperwhite was the obvious choice because of the lit screen.when i first received it , i was slightly disappointed . the screen has a strange feel , it flickers when you switch from book to home screen or anything else . it weighed more than i expected , slightly more than my phone . after using the device for a couple of days , i have to say : i love it . i ca n't believe how much more pleasant reading is on this device . my eyes are not as tired so i can read for hours . i love the size of the screen and the adjustable lighting . the weight is not an issue , it is very comfortable to hold . if you read for pleasure , this is the way to go !

> the two five-star reviews here seem familiar with the career of giuliano carmignola , but all i know is that he serves as concertmaster for abbado 's new italian ensemble , the orchestra mozart of bologna . presumably these are live concert recordings of th five mozart violin concertos , plus the sublime sinfonia concertante for violin and viola ( with added soloist danusha waskiewicz ) . this 2-cd set at a bargain price is the companion to a similar twofer of mozart symphonies from abbado . but here the style is more period-flavored . i think anyone listening blind , in fact , would assume that the conductor was gardiner , norrington , or any number of hip specialists.i 'm no fan of that style , but these readings are lively and infectious . none of the mozart violin concertos rises to the tank of his masterpieces for piano , so giving them a brisk , elegant run does n't strip away the patina of genius . carmignola also plays like a period soloist ; his tone is a bit zingy to my taste , but his intonaiton is dead on pitch . everything goes along bright and sparkling , which gets tiresome , but that no doubt is a minority opinion . the sinfonia concertante is almost off-handed as it zips along , and here i feel a serious loss , becasue this music deserves more . the first movement is nerve-racking in its impatience , and the finale , conducted one to a bar , disappears before you know it.in all , i 'll give three stars in full recognition that enthusiasts for hip performances will think that 's far too stingy .

> decorating schemes by ginny aiken is the second book in the deadly decor mystery series . i think that this series is undergoing an identity crisis . it wants to be a humorous , light mystery , but real human drama keeps sneaking in . it 's hard as a reader to take some of the characters , like bella , seriously when she ca n't seem to string together a sentence without mispronouncing a word , but then haley has so many demons she 's fighting , it 's difficult to balance them both in the same book . bella is obviously a character , but haley seems much more real . haley , an interior designer , again stumbles upon a dead body while getting ready to remodel a home . this time the body is that of a young girl , and haley 's former nemesis dutch merrill is the prime suspect . lily tsu makes another appearance , but this time she comes off as far less capable . haley 's father does some things that seem so out of character , he seems unreal as well . because the book tries to maintain a light edge , when haley solves the mystery , the resolution seems extremely dark . what she finds underwater repulsed me and seemed out of place with the rest of the book . aiken also leaves a lot of unanswered questions in this entry ; i was a bit disappointed . here 's hoping she solves the identity crisis with the entry due in august .

> what a stinker . i mean , the first `` blade '' movie was n't exactly high art , but at least it had some enjoyable moments . this sequel , by contrast , is dreary and belaboured , everything too calculated and cold ... i 'm sure they meant for it to be stylish and sexy , but it 's all just dreadfully dull . the film sets up the most hackneyed cliches ( blade the loner gets set up with a super team , a punkish/modern primitive vampire platoon , which he must lead to defeat their common foe ... ) but instead of following through on the premise , the filmmakers just let it drop to the floor , as flat as everything else in the movie . no one bothers to embue the members of the group with any personality -- why bother ? they 're going to die anyway . in fact , they hardly get any dialogue at all , not even a wisecrack or cynical aside . it 's all just chop chop chop hack hack slice dice chop chop chop . hack . slice slice slice . bang bang bang . boom . chop . slice . pow . chop . bang bang bang . techno fetishism and grotty special effects are supposed to save this film , but once again , we learn the lesson that razzle dazzle and gimmickry in and of themselves can not make a dead film fly . an 11+ on the yawn-o-meter .

> my fourteen year old nephew got this for christmas and he loved it . i went into this expecting just a lightweight fast action movie , not serious brain food . after all not all movies can be `` pride and prejudice '' or `` mystic river '' . fans of fast action flying movies should enjoy `` stealth '' . times have changed since tom cruise did `` top gun '' . here we have two capable actors and one actress to keep us hyped up , and a robot pilot that makes `` star wars '' jealous . the premise of hotshot pilots protecting the american way certainly is n't new . even the computer pilot copies a little from other movies where the machines go inhumane ( e.g . forbin project , war games , blade runner , i robot , etc. ) . this is still a very entertaining movie . i have n't decided if i will buy it yet , but i am certainly glad i saw it . i would say for the majority it will be a fun two hours . the rating suffices to say it is not for young children . mainly because of the psychological reasons presented . i think it has replayabilty and it is a good buy as a gift for most men and boys . get yourself a bowl of popcorn and sit back for some action entertainment .

> this is as good as it gets . brian large does a superb directing job in a 1982 covent garden la boheme which brings together as good a group of singing actors as one will find within perfectly designed sets to make for an opera in which every moment is alive with the appropriate emotions . it would be piling it on , so to speak , to detail the strengths of each participant but one must mention that ileana cotrubas makes every word , spoken and sung , an intimate part of her characterization , neil shicoff , then quite new to the opera game , uses his voice beautifully to create vocal character rather than simple gymnastics , marilyn zschau , fulfills the very difficult role requirement that musetta be a coquette with a heart of gold , and , so for each , acting and singing are married to a degree only found among the best productions . it is a lesson in what we mean by modern opera , whether fantasy or realism , every expression of music , song , physical movement , setting is harmonized to further apprehension and appreciation of the opera 's underlying theme , its reason for being , its elan vital.highly recommended for the beginning and the veteran opera lover .

> anolon nouvelle copper stainless steel 8-inch and 9-1/2-inch nonstick skillet twin packi have been using analon for a while now and i was thrilled to see these 2 pans being marketed . they are just perfect for a meal for one or two people or for doing a bit of saut & eacute ; ing for side dishes.these two skillets ( sized at 8 inches and 9.5 inches ) are perfectly weighted - neither too heavy as to make it impossible to deal with , nor are they too light so as to burn things or scorch too easily . they are gorgeous to look at and perfect no matter what kind of stove you are using , which includes glass and induction stove tops . thank heavens they are dishwasher safe also , although they are so easy to clean because of the heaviness of the non-stick interior and fact that the exterior just seems to be so well made and polished that they do n't need heavy scrubbing.these may seem like expensive saut & eacute ; pans but they are going to last a lifetime and will be the perfect gift for any of the cooks on your holiday or wedding list .

> tackling the quiz-show scandals that rocked the days of early television , robert redford 's intelligent , absorbing drama digs into the murky ethics of mass-media entertainment . turturro and fiennes are both excellent , playing antagonists whose ethnicity is as much a concern to image-conscious programmers as their smarts . paul scofield won an oscar for his turn as van doren 's patrician father , while rob morrow is memorable as a boston attorney who helps turturro blow the whistle . `` quiz show '' remains one of cinema 's best meditations on our tricky dealings with the almighty tube .

> the coen brothers ' third film is a gorgeous and brilliant modern take on the classic gangster film . a flawless cast , headed by gabriel byrne in his best role ever , includes albert finney , john turturro , marcia gay harden and joe polito -- even brief appearances from steve buscemi , frances mcdormand and sam raimi . every performance is terrific , but byrne & # 65533 ; s tom reagan is a revelation & # 65533 ; - a complex loner who can take a punch and hold on to his hat . sets and costumes are beautiful , barry sonnenfeld brings considerable talent as dp , and carter burwell & # 65533 ; s music is haunting . this is an often forgotten or underrated film by the brothers coen , but don & # 65533 ; t miss it & # 65533 ; - it presages later devices ( our hero lives at the barton arms , for instance ) and is worthwhile in its own right.the dvd is sparse and has no vocal input from its creators , which seems passing strange , and a shame , but you can hear the film in english , french or spanish , with subtitles available in english or spanish , and there is a fun 16-minute featurette called & # 65533 ; shooting miller & # 65533 ; s crossing : a conversation with barry sonnenfeld & # 65533 ; , really a monologue about his experience , style and philosophy , including brief storyboard-film comparisons and a hysterical revelation about the ladies & # 65533 ; room scene . there are also 22 behind-the-scenes photos ; trailers for miller & # 65533 ; s crossing , barton fink and raising arizona ; and multiple interview soundbites from byrne , harden and turturro.this is an ingenious genre film with twists , turns , double-crosses , great dialogue , beautiful shots and a superb cast , and it & # 65533 ; s great to have it out on dvd . an essential film .

> grace jones was a huge star in europe in the late 70s/early 80s with irresitable reggae/disco/dance tunes , and this compilation brings the essential tracks of that era . `` island life '' ( released in 1985 ; 10 tracks ; 48 min . ) brings all of the hits of that era , starting with a clever interpretation of edit piaff 's `` la vie on rose '' , a massive hit in continental europe . the radical dub reinventing of the pretenders ' `` private life '' is outstanding . i do n't care much for the roxy music 's cover of `` love is the drug '' . but the best tracks are on the second half of this compilation : `` pull up to the bumper '' will get any wallflower onto the dance floor . `` walking in the rain '' is a desolate , threatening tune , just great . it leads up to the best track of all , `` my jamaican guy '' , the best dance tune ever from grace jones . almost 30 years later , is still stands the test of time , just outstanding.grace jones has come back with a new album last year ( `` hurricane '' ) , out of nowhere really ( i have n't heard it yet , but plan to ) . she played a one-off gig in london not long ago that was well received , i can only hope she 'll go on tour , i 'd love to see her in concert . meanwhile , if you are looking for a compilation of her best work from the legendary late 70s/early 80s era , look no further , this compilation will do more than well .

> note : emmanuelle riva was nominated for the oscar shortly after i wrote this review . she is the female lead , pictured , and as a young woman was the lead in hiroshima mon amour , a foreign film classic.i ca n't say this depressed me . however , i must warn you that this may happen to a viewer . this is not an easy film to watch . it involves a married couple in old age . she has a stroke which is very disabling . she lives at home with him and he tries to handle it . but she keeps getting worse . this movie is about the end for them . they are a couple who have been in love their whole lives . they had a complete life together . they have a grown daughter . you see early pictures of them and they were beautiful . plus we know they are talented and affluent . all of that makes no difference when old age and last illnesses set in . it is a long spiral down and as the husband says to the daughter , '' it is very bad , it will only get worse and then it will be over . '' that is the film.i have been through this with various family members who lived into their eighties and nineties and then got strokes and alzheimer 's . watching this is hell . but his love for her is complete as she begins and progresses along the descent.i frankly found it very engrossing and the acting is out of this world . these do not even seem like actors it is so life like .

> i bought this to save my marriage , lol . my husband could n't hear the tv with our rambunctious 2-year old around without cranking up the volume to headache-level and constant rewinding . i got him these wireless headphones for watching tv and they have been great for us . there is no hiss or interference , and the sound is really good . he can set his volume on the headphones and i can have my own volume on the tv ( or i can mute it ) . they are easy to recharge ( just throw them on the hanger ) . i do have to look before i adjust the volume since the control is located on the ear , but it 's no big deal -- i mean , where else could you put the control on a wireless headset ? the controls are very easy to use . the only drawback is that lying on your side ( vegging on the couch a la `` jabba the hut '' ) can be uncomfortable if you rest your head on a pillow or couch arm because of the size ( but i knew that when i bought them- it 's not like they 're earbuds ) . it took my husband about five minutes to hook this up . so now my husband can watch all the sci-fi he wants and he 's free to help me run after the little guy ( hooray for wireless ! ) . and i do n't get headaches . these things are great for our purposes ! ! we have no complaints .

> if moore 's law runs on a cycle of 18 months to 2 years , then since the apple 1 came out in 1975-6 , that 's at least 15 cycles . if you imagine a cycle to be like a human generation of 25 years , say , then some 370 years have passed since its debut ! which may explain the allure of this book to some . perhaps you were too young to have been rubbing shoulders with wozniak and jobs at the san francisco homebrew computer club in 1975. heck , maybe you grew up with the web and browsers . ( punk . ) owad gives you a time tunnel . hands on wiring and then coding in a dead assembly language . feel what it was like for wozniak.the book is even educational . imagine that ! today 's software is all covered in guis and ghz cpus and gbyte disks . many programmers rarely ( if ever ) code in any assembler . a merit of the book is that it takes you back to the basics of computing . sweating out assembly may give you a better appreciation of what all that high level source code you pound out ultimately has to do.if you are going to indulge in trying out the material , you should get more into the spirit of its time . try playing a cassette [ sic ] tape of abba or the eagles , while coding .

> after reading the reviews , i bought these wireless headphones several years ago when their price was lower than its $ 90 it is today ( 12/08/2013 ) . i wanted these headphones so my wife and i could listen to tv programs without disturbing our our sons while they did their homework . we bought a pair and plugged their inputs into the audio output jacks on the back of the cable box . all that was required after that was to mute the audio on the tv whenever we wanted to listen without distracting our kids.the headsets use nicad batteries . the batteries recharge any time the headset is resting on the base unit 's wire support frame . status leds will tell you when they are correctly positioned for charging . after about 3 years of use we did have to replace one set of batteries but they are generic aaa cells that you can buy anywhere . the headphones have a very good reception range and i can state that they work up to at least 50 feet from the base when used in a wooden structure.if you want to use these to listen to music , i am sure they will provide an adequate sound but they were probably not designed to provide the same quality of listening experience you will have with high-end , wired audio headphones.i do not hesitate to recommend these .

> & quot ; my love is your love & quot ; is the album whitney should have been making all these years , from the days when she released big , soaring ballads that rivaled mariah carey 's in the schmaltz department . but on this album , we get slammin grooves , mainly produced by rodney jerkins . & quot ; it 's not right , but it 's okay & quot ; could very well be whitney 's best single ever ( and the thunderpuss remix is even better ) ; it 's an assertive , self-confident number about walking out of a dead-ended relationship . & quot ; if i told you that & quot ; ( which would later feature george michael on the grestest-hits disc ) also shines , and wyclef jean gives the album a welcome reggae lilt on the beautiful title track . my cut of choice , however , is a song that was n't even released : & quot ; get it back. & quot ; even the diane warren-penned & quot ; i learned from the best & quot ; is also pretty good ( which is really saying something ) . only towards the end of the album do we get a couple of subpar tunes . nevertheless , this album finally made it cool to like whitney , and i strongly recommend this cd .

> i loved the first novel of this series and was reasonably happy with the second . but the third just does n't work . ***spoilers in case there is anybody who does n't already know the ending***whether she intended to do so or not , the author raises certain expectations in her readers when she creates a strong romance plot . likewise when she writes most of a series in the first person heroine 's point of view -- i.e. , you ca n't tell your story if you 're dead . switching to a dual pov in the final book is a giveaway that either tris or tobias is n't going to survive , but unfortunately the dual perspectives do n't ring true , since the two voices are too similar.killing the heroine/hero of any novel is a huge risk , and it really only works when the readers are expecting a tragic ending . in a series like this one , we expect triumph at the end , not to mention a happy resolution for the primary romance . but when the trilogy can be summed up with `` your mom dies , your dad dies , your friends die , then you die '' there 's not much to celebrate or feel good about . the world sucks and then you die . i read books to escape that unhappy reality !

> dark blue is another good cop/bad cop film along the lines of training day and is in many ways as good as that oscar film . kurt russell gives a fully realized performance as a cop caught in the dire web of continuing a family tradition of being a policeman with the inherent pledge of faith to those in command , even though the cops in charge are on the take in the world of crime in which they live . russell is strong , plays the 'role ' expected of him from the crime perpetrators both without and within the police world . his new partner ( a fairly strong role for scott speedman ) is fresh enough to eventually see through the corruption and save himself from the cancer that destroys the others . sopporting roles are excellent - lolita davidovich and ving rhames giving their usual sensitive dimensions to their characters . the only problem - and it is a real problem - comes in the sound editing and musical scoring . even though this film is in english , i recommend you turn on the subtitles in order to follow the dialogue buried in booming hiphop music and muffled gangsta talk . grady harp , march 13

> my super sweet sixteenth century by rachel harris stars cat the daughter of a hollywood star who finds herself transported to the sixteenth century during a trip to italy with her father and his fiancee . cat has taken the place of patience a girl from london who has been sent to florence after the death of her parents . cat initially enjoys her trip but soon finds that she misses her home . will she be able to learn the lessons that she needs to be sent back to her own time ? i loved this book . the fish out of water aspect was done well and the plot worked well with a nice ending that had a great resolution . i loved the descriptions of the time period from the clothes to the servants . the characters were very well developed , from the crushworthy romantic interest to cat/patience 's cousin who helps her navigate the time period.appropriateness : there is a bit of wine drinking ( which is appropriate for the time period ) but no drunken behavior . the romance is innocent and consists of nothing more than a few sweet kisses . i would recommend this book to readers 13+

> not that i 'm the biggest dead kennedys fan out there - but i 've only had maybe a total of three of their cd 's ever . but as i always give credit where credit is due - 'live at the deaf club ' does indeed deliver plenty to those old school dk fans , followers and devotees . fourteen full-throttled blistering punk dead kennedys songs performed in a mere thirty-nine minutes . suburb sound quality to be thoroughly taken in - with rockers like the in-your-face `` kill the poor '' , `` california uber allies '' , `` ill in the head '' ( a possibly anthem ? ) , definitely one of their better-recognized songs `` holiday in cambodia '' and a couple of covers that i most certainly did n't expect - the honeycomb 's `` have i the right '' and the beatles `` back in the u.s.s.r.

> the charisma that mel gibson and julia roberts have developed over the years is the saving grace of this convoluted , overly plotted movie . written by brian helgeland ( la confidential , mystic river , a knight 's tale ) , it tells the story of a conspiracy obsessed cabbie ( gibson ) who finally stumbled onto a conspiracy that involves his unrequited love ( roberts ) . heading up the bad guys is x-men 's patrick stewart , who gives a solid performance as dr. jonas/henry finch.the movie seemed a little too long , and some middle sags deleted some of the suspense . gibson performs admirably , although it 's just a little bit more of the lethal weapon personna unharnessed . roberts is not a great actress ( in spite of erin brockovich ) , but she is a great presence , and donner films her with all the right lights and angles to enhance this . someone like laura linney would have made the role much more memorable.but as entertaining , if confusing , fluff , conspiracy theory is a fun movie to watch .

> i 've had mine for a couple of weeks now and like it . i got it because it was the only model with an ethernet port ( i am wired for ethernet ) and because the software is very quick . the interface design and the speed of response shames verizon fios - their ux designers clearly quit in about 2005 and the entire experience is dreadfully kludgy to the user.all new kindles have the new software now so if you do n't want the fast response times and a cat5 connection , the moderately cheaper wifi only models work just fine.the apple tv i compared it to performs very similarly but if you are not locked into the apple ecosystem it is a poorer choice for the same price . apple tv demands you live your life through itunes and of course that means you can not get amazon content without hacking the box which is a headache and voids your warranty . the roku does offer a broader range of channels than the itv if you are not locked into steve job 's igulag .

> murdoch is , to say the least , one of the more controversial figures in media today . his name still inspires visions of the pitched battles that have arisen around the pieces of his empire and the ethical debates about the role of journalism and issues of media ownership . there is a tremendous amount to be learned from studying murdoch and the way he built his kingdom , and this book is not to be missed , particularly for people studying media history or the media industry.shawcross presents a very balanced picture , light on both censure and praise , and manages to give enough personal detail to illuminate the public murdoch without veering into a personal melodrama . the writing is occasionally a bit dry , but generally of a high quality & amp ; the source notes and bibliography are quite valuable in and of themselves .

> first of all , gothic fantasy is not my preferred genre.that said , andrew davidon 's `` gargoyle '' is a compelling , well-written tale that envelopes the reader in a world that exists alongside the ordinary reality we all share . it is easy to be hypnotized and seduced into participating in this dangerous dimension where base fears and desires are realized on a level that is almost visceral.i wo n't spoil the reading pleasure by dissecting the story , that would n't be fair to potential readers , but i am recommending it to those who are drawn to this kind of story and the legion of fans for the spirit and mood and world of the vampire novels that anne rice is best known.there is horror and redemption.hard to believe this is davidon 's first novel .

> helped me to understand better what was also going on behind the scenes during kennedy 's presidency . i was touched by the devotion of jackie to her husband , but after so many affairs he treated her with little respect ; that is unless she was pregnant with his child . it is another story of how men with such power abuse their marriage vows and this seems to be historically true from the beginning of the political system in this country and continues today . men seem to loose their brains when they pull down their pants ... .and john kennedy was depicted as one of the biggest cheaters in the presidency . i was surprised to learn that so many people despised him and continually tried to discredit his presidency even today .

> over the years i 've read most of nicholas sparks ' novels . sometimes the movie 's better . sometimes the book . yet he is remarkably prolific , popping out a novel or two every year since 1996.. his characters are simple , and the plots are well-paced . insafe haven , katie moves to a small , southern town determined to make it on her own . she finds a job waitressing and rents a dilapidated house in the sticks.little by little , the author reveals information on katie 's background . she was married to a police offer . isolated and abused for years . she once went by a different name . it does n't take long before she catches the eye of a gray haired , thirty-something widower . he runs the local grocery store and seems to pay careful attention to her every need.katie begins bonding with the widower and his two young children , slowly healing from her past as she relishes the small pleasures of safety and security . the love story is not as predominant in safe haven as it is in other nicholas sparks novels . more significant is the protagonist developing self-identity and confidence in her ability to persevere.toward the end of the novel , katie confronts some of the demons of her past , risking not only her own safety but those of her new friends in town . the sole flaw of the novel is that the two main characters have no real flaws . there is some overlap between this book androse madder . sparks has a core audience that will devour all his works regardless of quality -- but this one stands the best chance of being read by non-fans well before the movie comes out in 2012 .

> i did n't pay a dime for this garden kit , so i had to question why i ordered this . the answer was fairly easy . i maintain a small herb garden in the warm months which is usually transplanted to small pots that reside in an insulted and lighted green house window when it gets cold . while this would satisfy my herb garden needs in the most minimal of ways and would be supplemented by other herbs , this would be a great way to get my granddaughter into gardening in a small and manageable way . as it turned out , this was perfect . we cleared and cultivated a small patch of land , ammended and supplemented the soil , dug evenly spaced holes , inserted the seeds and their own pods , and watered and weeded.since everything in the set was done for us down to the proper depth of seed placement , all we needed to depend on was mother nature . germination has been quick . my granddaughter is thrilled with her accomplishments and comes over every day to weed and water . sure , we are not getting a huge yield that will feed the family for all summer or even a few meals . however , this is a first easy step into getting into gardening and green sustainability . on this score , i think this product is a nice approach to introduce a child to gardening or creating an urban rooftop garden . overall , it simplifies the steps i normally follow each spring when i start prepping my regular garden . despite being overpriced for what it is , it simplifies gardening for kids and would be gardeners .

> sylvia ( vee ) bell is n't narcoleptic as her family and friends believe . instead of falling asleep , she `` slides '' into someone else 's body and experiences whatever they 're doing at the time . this is how she knows that sophie did n't kill herself - vee was briefly in the body of her killer . but vee ca n't tell anyone , as no one would believe her . so , vee takes it upon herself to discover the killer 's identity before they strike again.vee is relatable and easy to sympathize with , as she 's gone through a lot in her short life . her best friend rollins seems like a great guy and good friend , yet he will suddenly act mysterious and standoffish . and vee 's younger sister is making bad choices , but with a deceased mother and absent father , vee has to step up and take on a parental role at home . hathaway 's characters are flawed , realistic and engaging.this ya thriller is a haunting and moving . i 'm not usually one for a lot of teen angst , but i was completely caught up in the relationship drama and heartbreakingly stupid choices that the teens made . there was one big reveal that was very predictable if the reader pays attention , but the chilling suspense was not lessened in any way . slide is an intense blend of fantasy , teen drama , thriller , and murder mystery . dark with plenty of suspense , i was unable to put this one down .

> i own two of these cases and they are amazing . one is built into a whs 2011 and the other is a home security video system . the case is classified as a mid-tower case but they hold a lot of equipment . it has 5 drive bays with 5.25 inch size and 5 internal hdd bays at 3.5 inch size . it even comes with a 5.25 '' to 3.5 '' drive bay convertor . my server has 10 sata drives mounted in it.it comes with 3 case fans but i load the case up with fans for high end cooling . the drive bays features tool free drive installation which is a nice feature . i did install a 3 bay 5.25 inch drive to 4 bay 3.5 inch hdd convertor . it is nice to have a big case to hold that many drives . there is also a top io panel that i use to put a usb memory stick into to make sure that i have all the drivers up to date and when i need to flash the motherboard bios.the case features room for 7 expansion slots and i use most of them for sata pci cards to handle that many hdds . the case will hold seven 120 mm fans for high efficiency cooling and i use 6 of them plus one in the bay converter because i have so many hard disk drives in the case . this is a great case and it is priced right . you ca n't go wrong with cooler master .

> ben webster was one of the most emotional tenor sax players in jazz , and his range of emotions was incredible . he could be feisty one minute , coy the next ; gruff on one tune , profoundly lyrical on the next ; conversational here , in-your-face there . all these feelings are on display in this excellent album.ben is at his most relaxed on the medium-tempo tunes ( makin ' whoopee and lover come back to me ) . it 's as if he 's having a front porch conversation with you on any ol ' thing , and on whoopee he is even sly at times and winking , too . on very slow ballads ( time on my hands and where are you ) he is pleading and mournful , tugging at the heartstrings.he plays two blues here , one medium-tempo where his tone is gruff , the other slow , where he is lyrical and subtle . ( oscar peterson is especially fine on the slow blues , the title track . ) the contrasts in his playing are marvelous and keep him forever fresh . three additional tracks from the session ( 10/15/57 ) appear on the cd that were not issued before and feature ben on piano ( he 's better on tenor any day of the week ) . this is a cd definitely worth checking out .

> vamps is a chick flick . it would most likely get a five star review at a taylor swift concert . alicia silverstone and krysten ritter play two vampires in the modern dating era . alicia dates back to the 1840 's and has trouble adjusting to modern gadgets , while krysten is at home with them . both of the women develop love interests . alicia meets an old boyfriend ( richard lewis ) from the 1960 's while krysten falls for a man named van helsing ( dan stevens ) who has a father who hunts vampires.the vamps are part of a support group who only drink animal blood . the jokes consist of mostly lame vampire humor such as women attempting to apply make-up without a mirror . there is one scene where alicia is looking through pictures of old boyfriends . one of the pictures is edgar allen poe . there were some scenes that worked and were funny . unfortunately too much of the film had humor and scenes that did n't make it for a mature audience . definitely only a rental . a sometimes fun film you might want to see once.parental guide : 1-f-bomb , implied sex , no nudity .

> this flick which is a average entry into the spoof genre , one that has direct roots to the classic movie `` airplane '' . in many ways they are all similiar from `` scary movie '' to 'hot shots '' they spoof a current trend or movie . in this one they mainly spoof 'spiderman '' ; but in spite of the extended gay and fart jokes it 's still entertaining . the main villian 'hourglass '' is actually a good supervillian that could fit well into any comic book or film based on a comic books . in fact most movies are storyboarded just like a comic book before shooting . so anyone who looks down at comics should forget about movies as well . this is n't a stand out performer in it 's genre but it 's what you expect and that 's some laughs and lots of silliness . since 'airplane ' there has been a alot of these over the top spoofs and they all have their moments and a basic similiar structure based on a outlandish gags . the blu ray print is as good as it gets and this is the only way to watch this movie if possible .

> this mouse installed easily and works satisfactorily . if you want a bluetooth mouse , this one is worthy of consideration.this mouse uses aaa batteries , which i dislike . aa batteries have a much longer life , and add desirable weight and heft to the mouse . my kensington bluetooth mouse uses aa batteries and this gives it a much nicer , more solid feel . and longer battery life.the scroll wheel on this mouse is not particularly good . it has a rough feel and if you press too hard you get that auto-scroll function when you do n't really want it . my kensington mouse , by comparison , was much less prone to accidental activation of that ( not very desirable ) auto-scroll feature.on the plus side , this mouse has a nice shape to it . it is smaller than most notebook mice , which is a plus . it does not have any lights that flash during use which seems to increase battery life and perhaps compensates for the aaa batteries.overall , a decent mouse that i liked better after some use than when i first started using it . rjb .

> as this wonderful movie opens , we enter the world of eve 's bayou , the louisiana home of ten-year old eve ( jurnee smollett ) and her charming , philandering father louis ( samuel l. jackson ) , her glamorous and superstitious mother , her psychic aunt ( debbi turner ) , and her big sister who idolizes daddy as much as eve does . the narrator 's opening line concerns a murder , and we wait for this terrible event to occur.i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie . it drew me in and held me spellbound , with it 's believable story and likeable characters . we really get to know and care about eve 's family and all their secrets . the actors are uniformly excellent , especially the young star , jurnee smollett . the director succeeds by constantly reminding us of the picturesque bayou setting and its unique community . as the story got closer and closer to the inevitable tragedy , i was almost holding my breath . it 's an intense story about real , multi-layered people . highly recommended .

> gilly is a stay at home mom who 's tired of catering to everyone else . when she is carjacked and taken hostage ( and talks the kidnapper into releasing her two children ) , she finds a certain solace in being away from her overly-demanding family . kidnapper todd never intended to abduct gilly , and gave her plenty of chances to escape . as the months go by , the two forge a strange bond , and gilly starts to feel empathy for the very troubled todd.there are certain things you expect from a megan hart novel , hot sex and an emotionally engaging storyline . this story is definitely emotional , just not the kind of story that i wanted to devote any length of time to . call me a pollyana , but i really like a happily ever after in a story , and this dark and grim tale just left me feeling empty.on aother note , i had a hard time with the lead character 's name - gilly - i kept picturing the goofy snl character .

> i wanted a simple , lightweight ball head for use with a carbon fiber tripod.light-weight is the key for me these days.the joby bh1 fills the bill.it is small , since it was designed to match another portable solution , the gorillapod . it is light . it is well-designed , though its quick release plate is not universal . it is simple to use : one-screw tightens everything . this latter point is also a killer for panorama and video shooters , particularly the latter : there are no separate adjustments for pan/tilt and rotation . panning with this head is n't worth the effort because the odds of getting a smooth linear pan are practically zero.i 've tried it only with smaller cameras so far and it works fine . i would n't even consider using it with a higher-end dslr and long zoom or telephoto.my only real complaint ? i think it is overpriced . otherwise a solid investment if you want to keep your field load light.jerry

> boston-area residents lived in fear of the boston strangler during the early 1960s . then on 3/12/63 a black man ( roy smith ) with a long criminal record ( thefts , minor assaults ) sent to help clean a home was arrested for the murder of the woman living there . roy did n't help his case by having friends twice drive him past his room the night of the murder because police were waiting for him . regardless , despite his having no injuries ( rare in a strangulation case ) and there being a 50+ minute gap between his leaving and the husband arriving to discover the body , roy smith was convicted and sentenced to life.at the same time , albert desalvo was working on an addition to the home where the author resided , then an infant . in march , 1964 desalvo was picked up on rape charges , and then told his attorney that he was the boston strangler and wanted to earn money by selling a book about it . legal technicalities prevented desalvo 's conviction for the murders , though he was given life for the unrelated sex charges he had been picked up on . ( desalvo had a long record of theft , assault , and sex crimes . ) '' a death in belmont 's '' focus is on whether desalvo also committed the murder roy smith was convicted of . the crime matched most of the strangler 's m.o . - except for taking place in a home instead of an apartment . on the other hand , some questioned whether desalvo was the boston strangler at all - his memory was sketchy , and some of his errors matched those reported in the newspapers.the `` bad news '' about `` a death in belmont '' is that we 'll never know . desalvo was murdered in prison , and roy smith died there as well - with a copy of his approved commutation papers on his prison hospital bed .

> in a twisted cult ritual on the banks of the black bayou outside new orleans , teen adrianna small learns that she is to become the sacrificial bride to an evil polygamist cult leader 's son as his rite of passage . all her instincts cause her to fight back in a deadly quest for her safety , and she eventually emerges from the swamp alone , frightened , and determined to escape the rough life her mother exposed her to . thirteen years later , she has once again reinvented herself , this time as britta berger , the editor of an erotic magazine , and is in receipt of graphic photos of a serial killers latest conquest . when she turns them into the police , she and jean paul dubois , the lead detective are immediately smitten with each other , though they both plan to steer clear for their own reasons . as the killer closes in and makes britta his confidante , it is apparent that the killings as well as the killer 's interest in britta are tied to her past . more victims are found , and soon it is apparent that a trap must be set to catch the culprit once and for all . the suspects are piling up , many with plenty to hide , but are any of them killers ? herron 's post-katrina bayou thriller will have the reader enthralled from the opening paragraph . she has , created an ingenious mo for her serial killer ( and pretty graphic at times ) , as well as a conflicted hero and tortured heroine . the chemistry between the leads is scorching . i did feel a little shortchanged on the identity of the culprit - i hate when authors create tons of red herrings and suspects only to toss in a surprise character with little page-time . other than that , my only gripe is the end came too quickly .

> novelists have had a field day with books about egyptian tomb curses , ever since the uncovering of king tut 's tomb in the 1920s . some of these books have been good , and some not so good . there have also been a plethora of mummy movies scaring ( or not ) the daylights out of viewers . this well written book is the latest entry into the mummy curse field.the main action takes place in a desolate and dangerous place on the upper nile called the sudd , where an archeological team is attempting to locate the tomb of the first pharaoh of the united upper and lower egypt . it 's quite an undertaking , and there are happening odd and sometimes dangerous things , that require the leaders of the expedition to call in the services of a professor who deals with unusual phenomena ( ghosts , spirits , etc. ) . when he arrives at the site , he is almost immediately thrust into the middle of a mysterious dig , and the strange findings that result from it.there is a very strong curse placed on those who would violate this tomb , but the leaders ignore it and go forward with their project . once the tomb is breached , the action moves forward very quickly . there is an odd and almost unbelievable discovery , and it appears as if the curse is coming true . action moves quite quickly in the latter part of the book , and it becomes difficult for the reader to put down the book to continue later . there 's a satisfactory ending , of a sort , and all ends fairly well , despite some horrific happenings and deaths.it 's a book well worth reading if your interest runs to thrillers , ghost-type stories , and plots concerning egyptian tombs . i enjoyed it , and i think that you will also .

> it 's very difficult to imagine a descendant of john jacob astor living a deprived life in a hudson river estate named rokeby , but this story unravels a tale that seems more like hard times/great expectations than the story of an epic american dynasty.alexandra aldrich details the astor aspect of the family legacy and when it started going into a gradual decline for the aldrich line . living in the decrepit servants quarters , aldrich deals with her errant parents who either gallivanting around the world or involved in extracurricular affairs . the so-called stable member of the family is the grandmother who is slowly losing her grip on reality as she descends into alcoholism . it is a grim tale that causes one to wonder how this can go on . however , i guess it is n't all that strange if you 've seen grey mansions which detailed the descent of the bouvier beale clan into mental illness and abject poverty . things go down hill so quickly for alexandra that she needs to assume the adult role of putting food on the table by borrowing money from the service station owner down the road.aldrich 's grim description of rokeby and the unenviable position of being a poor astor makes for a potent read that had me rooting for her in the hope that she would survive and thrive and get away from her parents.generally , i liked this book a lot though it did leave me questioning where the money came from to support her mother 's lifestyle among many other things . it was well written and tells an interesting story .

> after replacing my old bathroom scale with this sleek , modern , easy-to-read scale , i could n't believe my eyes when i stepped on and weighed almost eight pounds heavier than my old scale . so , i put it to the litmus test and placed my two eight-pound hand weights on there , and it registered at 15.6 pounds so if anything , this scale is a fraction of weight under . the price is right too ! good scale !

> these ear buds are just as good as it gets for the price . i use these for running , and have always had problems with expensive ones breaking after a few months , due to sweat . i paid , i think , $ 5.99 for these , and they are a great value for the price . good sound quality and they fit nicely into my ear holes ( which are rather quite small ) .

> the yeah yeah yeahs have been around for a number of years , creating major buzz with their live shows , fronted by vocalist karen o. their 2004 debut album `` fever to tell '' got an unexpected lift from the break-out single `` maps '' , which ironically is not really representative of the band 's sound , but so what . now comes the second album . `` show your bones '' ( 11 tracks , 39 min . ) starts with the first single `` gold lion '' , which is a great tune , if somewhat understated . next is `` way out '' , which i would call the `` maps '' tune of this album , just excellent . other highlights include `` phenomena '' , which brings the sounds of the band 's earliest days , as does `` honeybar '' , and `` mysteries '' . the band 's sound is more fully fleshed out on the album , even with only 2 instrumentalists ( drums , guitars ) , but of course that is the luxury of the studio . karen o reminds me of what the pretenders ' chrissie hyne would be like , if she was that age today . in all , an excellent album , and at 39 min. , the album clips by quickly and you 'll want to play again and again.you will not find this music played on mainstream radio ( unless `` way out '' becomes another semi-breakout smash ) , but this album confirms that the yyys are one of the better indie-rock bands out there these days . and if you have a chance to catch the yyys in concert , do n't miss them , they wo n't disappoint you .

> a young girl is placed with a foster family in a small town outside of munich in 1939. on the way to her new home , her brother dies and is buried . the girl sees a book lying about and steals it ( it is the gravediggers manual ) even though she does not yet know how to read . she is taught by here kindly foster father , a painter by vocation and an accordion player by avocation and continues stealing books..rescuing one from a nazi book burning and then stealing others from the wife of the mayor who has her laundry done by the girl 's step mother . narrated by death , who eventually and inevitably visits everyone in the book , it is a look at what life was like in the nazi germany that existed behind the one we all know about . children grew up doing the kind of things that children do - going to school , playing soccer after school , having adventures and learning about life . they also had to participate in hitler 's youth movement . the book spirals through a number of substories . the most significant of which concerns the family hiding a jew in their basement and as the war winds down for germany things get progressively worse for the townsfolk . this is a beautifully written book with well drawn characters and a strong story line . it will leave you emotionally drained at the end . this is a book i will read again and again .

> johnny guitar is a very enjoyable western melodrama with joan crawford , strikingly filmed in colour , as vienna the misunderstood saloon owner who spearheads the drive for a railroad to be built through her small town . she comes under the hatred and scorn of her fellow townsfolk , not the least of which a scary pariah called emma small ( played wonderfully by mercedes mccambridge in another of her trademark characters with bull-dyke tendencies ) . vienna 's only help lies in her former love , johnny guitar ( sterling hayden ) . when vienna is accused of taking part in a robbery it sets into motion a chain of events that could end in her lynching ... this film is a hair 's breath from being high-camp . joan crawford plays vienna in her usual style , exchanging insults and threats with mccambridge in the film 's most memorable scenes . a choice line of mccambridge is `` she 's nuthin ' but a railroad tramp '' . watching their scenes made me think of faye dunaway and diana scarwid in mommie dearest , they seem to create the same energy on screen , perhaps they watched johnny guitar in preparing for their performances ? ... johnny guitar is more than a western , and a must-see for fans of crawford .

> `` the grascals '' is a satisfying bluegrass set from this nashville sextet . covering ground from ground from bluegrass to country , the stellar instrumental work and tight harmonies create an excellent set . `` morning dove '' is an excellent bluegrass tune with david talbot 's banjo making them sound like a nouveau version of the dillards . the two instrumentals are crackerjack affairs with david talbot penning the original `` bevans lake crossing '' and jimmy mattingly 's fiddle stroking the traditional `` sally goodin . '' my favorite track is the traditional `` saro jane '' with terry eldredge & jamie johnson 's tight vocal harmonies , `` i got a gal who 's sweet to me , but she lives down in tennessee . '' grascles take `` some things i want to sing about '' from the osborne brothers and show that an excellent country tune does n't have an expiration date , `` daddy was in danville working for the railroad , when he was coming home , we could n't wait . '' their single with dolly parton swinging on `` viva las vegas '' is a sweet track . the set concludes with the spiritual `` sweet by & by . '' this is a delicious debut cd ! enjoy !

> this book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written . it is a book about how psychological research , motivational research was being employed at the time to sell americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want , or were n't necessarily very good for them . sounds very much like reality as we now know it . this selling also extended to politicians , and packard foresaw the way the image would become in many instances more important than the message in choice of political candidates.as i said the book is filled with information . i am embarassed to say that i have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned packard 's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one 's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth . brush after you eat , he advises , as i now recall many dentists have told me through the years.in any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture .

> if one were to fill a musical time capsule , then `` unforgettable : with love '' would be placed in it . not only is the album does the album pay tribute to one of the all-time greats of music , cole 's father nat , but it is a multiple grammy-winner that appealed to fans of many genres.cole is very effective singing the standards made famous by her father and realizes that his stamp is emblazoned on most of them . she never tries to imitate him , just offers her own spin on such gems as `` mona lisa , '' `` smile , '' `` straighten up and fly right , '' `` nature boy , '' and `` our love is here to stay . `` of course , no musical collection would be complete without the landmark and one-of-a-kind ( at the time ) pairing of father and daughter on `` unforgettable . `` the song is just as the title says and worthy of the praise it has garnered since its release.i ca n't believe that i did n't buy this album sixteen years ago.where was my brain ? ? ?

> instead of repeating the winning formula of & quot ; yoshiesque , & quot ; deep dish return with a solid volume 2 that differs in mood and flavor . the tempo is a bit faster , and we get more trance than house this time around . disc one did n't appeal to me at first , but it succeeds by the excellent mixing and melange of diverse grooves featuring the mid-tempo beats of chemical brothers to other upbeat , energetic house grooves with a dash of techno . give it a couple of listens , and it will grow on you . disc two ( which , like disc 1 , is 78 minutes ) is more my flavor , with more traditional house numbers and less trance . standouts include the opener & quot ; finally & quot ; by kings of tomorrow and morel 's & quot ; funny car. & quot ; sequels may have a reputation of disappointing , but volume 2 is a smart step forward for the remixing duo of dubfire and sharam . in my school of music , this cd gets a b .

> on this helpful cassette cd , louise hay provides a powerful psychological tool for healing oneself . she explains the power of memory and emotion in the healing process ; she talks about her own life , how she was abused as a child and how she overcame this trauma through the application of understanding and forgiveness . it also discusses the principles of personal transformation and contains a beautiful healing meditation that includes sections on how to forgive oneself and others , how to let go of negative thoughts and how to become the optimistic , joyful and created person that we were all meant to be . hay has a powerful reassuring voice and her words exude confidence , insight and optimism . i highly recommend this cd to all who need psychological support in physical or mental healing . in my experience it has been most effective . also listen to her tape meditations for personal healing , a series of meditations that covers all the important aspects of life and self-esteem : motivational affirmations for building confidence and recognizing self-worth .

> i first read this book 15 years ago , and it has n't lost its magic . while much of the rest of the star wars expanded universe has become bogged down with irrelevant characters and unrealistic plot twists , timothy zahn 's heir to the empire trilogy actually manages to recapture the feeling of the original star wars trilogy . the original characters all play great roles and the ploy is well paced . more important , this book introduced several of the expanded universe 's most beloved characters , from mara jade to grand admiral thrawn . i did think zahn did go a bit overboard with c'baoth at the end . however , thrawn 's ending is easily one of the most dramatic of any in the expanded universe . overall , this trilogy is required reading for any star wars fan ( the other books - not so much ) . too bad there has n't been anything to match this since the early 1990s .

> reason i 'm giving this 2-cd , 1 dvd repackaging of the landmark hawkwind live 1972 album is because of the asking price . i already own copies of the one way 2-cd reissue as well as the later emi import reissue with the concert 's two encore songs . so , what do i need with this pressing ? the twenty song dvd is packed with hawkwind classics like `` space is deep '' , `` orgone accumulator '' , `` brainstorm '' and so on but sadly enough there is no actual concert footage , as some would have been nice . the provided graphics that accompany these tunes are 'okay ' at best . this newly re-packaged release of 'space ritual ' would do more for a fan that 's never had this record on cd , or perhaps a new hawkfan { do many even exist ? } . i would hope so . mainly aimed toward the extreme die-hard collectors .

> pink floyd / animals ( 1992 remastered cd ... printed in usa ) : evidently , after `` dark side '' , some folks forgot that pink floyd was always a progressive rock band and not a pop hit maker . animals is a % 100 progressive album and a very good one as well . this is far from being a ` masterpiece ' but it 's an album every music lover ought to have anyway . as a slight matter of preference , i like the old 1992 remaster over the 2011 remaster , but both are excellent . four stars .

> `` i want to play a game . '' well , we all knew that . but with jigsaw dead , how does the saw series keep the game from becoming overtly predictable ? the answer is not revealed in `` saw v , '' which shows the series becoming an utterly predictable halloween event.jigsaw ( tobin bell , weirdly malevolent as ever ) is still dead . that minor fact , however , does not negate his being in `` saw v '' in various states of criminal commission , with or without detective mark hoffman ( costas mandylor ) as his accomplice . still hot on the case fbi agent pete strahm ( scott patterson ) is on hoffman 's trail , and there are five hapless but interconnected folks now secured in one of jigsaw 's traps.the traps are , as usual , freaky . the fbi cops are trying to figure out who dunnit . mrs. jigsaw discovers she has inherited a mysterious box from her dearly departed , but we are n't allowed to see the contents after she peeks in ( hmmm , preview of the plot for `` saw vi '' ? ) . what is missing is any sense of newness to the film , or a real hard twist at the end . for a film with a tagline of `` you wo n't believe how it ends , '' that 's only partway true . i was really expecting more.while i still thinksaw iiis the best of the series , `` saw v '' comes off as little else than a cop caper with some of that old time gore tossed in for squeamish factor.saw ivwas definitely more squirm inducing , which makes you wonder why they did n't spend a little more time trimming the fat and adding a bit more slashing . as a cop chase flick with a side plot of torture , `` saw v '' comes off as just an average flick . of course , i 'll be back next halloween .

> `` the dracula chronicles : bound by blood - volume 1 '' by shane o'neill is an excellent dracula story . combining the myth with history and significant events in the development of the catholic church the book has a lot to offer.the story begins with one battle in a long winded struggle by vlad iii dracula , voivode of wallachia to re-gain his throne and power . close to victory he gets wounded and strikes a deal with lucifer . dracula is to gain eternal life in exchange for playing a significant role against the catholic church.the books then follows vlad iii dracula doing just that : in the italy of the medici 's and machiavelli , the court in london and in a germany just before luther 's reforms.these historical elements in the book are really well done and make this an enjoyable and intelligent read that easily surpasses most vampire and dracula stories . there is a competence and power in this writing that makes the story feel very real , despite the paranormal aspects.the characters are well developed and the dialogue runs very smoothly . the paranormal aspects of the story are what i expected to like the least but they too are written with care and attention to detail . i often feel that as vampires are the flavour of the season many writers make details about their vampires and the life they lead up as they go along , leaving the reader with a lot of confusion and inconsistencies . o'neill has avoided such downfalls and never lost my attention or trust . the book is powerful , competent and very engaging.highly recommended for all fans of the genre but particularly for those who also appreciate literary quality .

> a pair of time travelers goes nearly 200 years into the past , setting into motion a series of events that will assemble the original crew of the starship enterprise under alternate circumstances , creating a new time line and rebooting the franchise.i should probably give this film 4 stars ; the plot is overly complicated , there is some clumsy exposition in the middle , and the villain ( eric bana ) is two dimensional . however , everything else is so perfect and the resulting picture gives this franchise the kick in the behind it has needed for many years . purists may find much to gripe about , but i am impressed by the way director j.j. abrams and screenwriters roberto orci and alex kurtzman have managed to push the reset button in a way that does not nullify more than 40 years of storytelling . let the novel writers and graphic artists carry on with the original star trek universe . now we have a great young cast portraying classic characters and forging their own continuity . zachary quinto and karl urban , as spock and mccoy respectively , give faithful presentations that do not resort to caricature . the rest of the cast -- zoe saldana as uhura , john cho as sulu , anton yeltsin as chekhov , and simon pegg as scotty -- create engaging characters that are quite different from the originals . chris pine , as kirk , does a good job of portraying a cocky young man who grows into the role of starship captain . i 'm looking forward to subsequent entries in the series .

> we 've been through two of these now . i had heard good things about them and got one through our baby registry . after a few months of carrying for it via the directions provided ( which require frequent cleaning ) , the motor started grinding and heating up and i did not want to leave it unattended in the baby 's room . i contacted amazon , who told me the item only had a 1 month return period . however , the item is listed as a baby registry category ( in fact there is a picture of it on the default registry screen ) -- baby items purchased through amazon mom/registry are listed as having a 1 year period . after several frustrating conversations with amazon they agreed to replace it . it 's now 2 months later and the replacement is now making the same grinding noise , despite following the directions and buying the filters . [ the filters are about 6-10 bucks a month so after a few months it would be more economical to just replace the humidifier than buy filters ] . i 've now contacted crane who will warranty it but want the item returned first , which is an issue with a sick baby who needs humidified air to breathe easier . crane has been slightly easier to deal with than amazon , but i 'd recommend finding another humidifier instead.incidentally , i 've googled the issue and found numerous at home fixes of loosening screws inside , etc , which crane does not suggest trying .

> this 1984 edition of carl von clausewitz 's seminal classic `` on war '' contains an excellent modern translation from the original german by military historians michael howard and peter paret , and superb introductory essays by paret , howard , and bernard brodie . the whole may be the best available presentation of clausewitz 's deep thoughts on the conduct of war . `` on war '' has been a staple of professional military education since its initial publication in 1832 , and prominent in american military studies since at least the 1980 's , a remarkable longevity for a book based primarily on its author 's experiences in the napoleonic wars . this longevity is all the more notable for the incomplete status of the book , as clausewitz died shortly after beginning substantial revisions . its continuing importance owes much to clausewitz 's grasp of the essentials of war , including his recognition of the reality of violence , his insistence on tying military means to rational political ends , and his explanation of the impact of friction and fog of war on its conduct.a decade of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency has raised questions as to the continuing relevance of `` on war '' , a question well-answered by bernard brodie 's prescient essay . in fact , the introductory essays alone would distinguish his edition from other options . clausewitz remains a difficult read , but this text continues to offer thought provoking insights . this edition is very highly recommended to students of the art of war .

> i am an avid reader . i read at least 100 books a year . years ago i got an ebook reader called rocketbook.long story short..i hate the machine . it was hard to use , hard to add more books to . it barely held many books and it was too heavy to use for long periods of time.i said well maybe its the reader and tried reading books on my laptop . it was awkward and the glare made me get an eye strain headache.aha ! so its ebooks that suck , i decided . i just could n't enjoy reading with an ebook.then i saw the kindle advertised . i did n't buy into the hype . another awkward piece of crap . but i then saw the sony eink device . i liked the technology so i researched the new eink readers.i decided on the kindle . my kindle came last week and i love it . why ? books are easy to order - either order them online or through the kindle . i receive them within a minute.no glare - yep the eink technology is awesome . its like reading a book . you can zone out and read . its not distracting at all.its light - it weighs less then most paperback even with the cover on.its convenient - no more lugging tons of books on vacation.so please if you are on the fence go ahead and get the kindle . i do n't regret it at all .

> this is a historical whodunit set in king cnut 's reign in 1018. i 'm a big fan of historical novels and whodunits so i was glad to be able to review this book.the writing is grammatically correct but somewhat contemporary and lacking in complexity . i also found it somewhat not smooth . after i finished the book , i read the back and found it to be originally written in danish and translated into english . that would explain my feelings about the writing . i can find no fault with the translation , but sometimes what is written in one language can not be fully translated into another . compared to cornwall 's saxon series , it lacks the depth and richness of the writing , but perhaps that is an unfair comparison.the story itself is not bad . once you get over the incongruity of an illustrator and noble scion being hired to investigate a murder , the author does a good job of describing early 11th century britain . the pair are novices at this type of thing and their investigation and the telling of it shows.overall , i think the author has done a good job of setting the backdrop for this murder mystery and anyone who likes historical britain may like this book .

> jerry dewitt was an undereducated young man wanting to be a pentecostal preacher . he poured his energies into studying the bible , and this book , for the first 150+ pages , is the detailed overview of this effort . in the process , god sent him messages , he felt divinely inspired to make life-changing decisions , and he remained poor and a recipient of various welfare programs.over a period of time , he changed his mind about lots of things , including religion . but the repetitive crises of faith he continued to experience ... enough ! the book is less on dewitt 's progression to becoming an atheist , and more on his efforts to develop his faith . it seemed the transition to atheist ocurred on one page in this memoir . he was n't one , then he says he was . but this was less than 2 years ago , after 20 years as a preacher.i will believe he is a true atheist in another 8 years . until then , this memoir tells me that his faith ebbs and flows , and some dramatic event could cause it to change yet again . be prepared .

> i admit , i was slow to buy the newer dylan cds . i 'm more into jakob and the wallflowers than his dad , now . but , i heard just one song from this cd and started checking out the cuts -- well , it 's worth buying the whole thing.dylan 's been backed by everyone , but this band is the best -- even better than the band or grateful dead , which i did n't think was possible . i think the reason is these guys were assembled by dylan for dylan.the songs are dark and long . dylan 's voice is a throaty rasp , but he 's a lot more understandable than his earlier work.my favorites : '' ai n't talkin '' talking about a man who 's gon na get gone . `` the levee 's gon na break '' good old southern style song with a gut punch . this literally sounds like a classic folk song , rather than something new from dylan 's pen . `` workingman 's blues # 2 '' lament about the condition of working today , including outsourcing.rebecca kyle , august 2008

> this is primarily a biography and portfolio of the work of hans bacher . other work from the disney archives are also included . there is a very thin narrative about the art of the animated film which does n't have a lot of substance.essentially this is a book about bacher , his adventures as a production designer for animated features and a gallery of his work.this alone is well worth the price of admission , though the paper quality is on the low side , the printing ordinary and the illustrations often very small . i guess bacher does n't rate a coffee table art book treatment.the `` instructional '' narrative often borders on the hilarious : `` for example , a love scene will need different colors than a suspense scene '' . okay . . .one of the best parts of the book , though done in a slap-dash manner , is the final chapter on the way animation used to be done with glass plates and 15 foot high camera platforms.all in all , an enjoyable , visually appealing , , though not fantastic , book.jerry

> loud , expensive , computer-generated `` event '' movies do little for this viewer , but peter jackson 's twenty-first century remake of the 1933 `` king kong '' sets this movie apart from the rest of its peers . the 1933 classic had crude special effects and even a vaguely racist undercurrent , but jackson 's signature touch could very well make this `` kong '' the definitive version . you know the story : a filmmaker desperate for a hit ( jack black ) recruits a struggling up-and-coming actress ann darrow ( naomi watts ) to star in what he hopes will be his blockbuster smash movie . he tricks her and screenwriter jack driscoll ( adrien brody ) into jumping on a ship to skull island where they badly clash with the natives who capture ann and offer her as a sacrifice to kong : an enormous 25-foot gorilla . surprisingly , kong bonds with ann , while a frantic search is made to find her while fighting off dinasoars , abnormally large insects , and other creatures . jackson piles on the action relentlessly , and the special effects are nothing short of thrilling . kong himself , generated from computer graphics and modeled after actor andy serkis , looks amazingly real , quite unlike the cardboard image of the 1933 original . but while this version towers over the 1976 remake , a couple scenes are n't quite believable , such as the moment where the crew frantically races with a pack of dinasoars and end up unharmed . sorry , i did n't buy it . other than that , this `` kong '' is very much worth your time . it packs a wild punch and it deserved its three technical oscars .

> this is a very handy way to light up a staircase . it 's a typical led light with a motion sensor , but is sized in a way that makes it very easy to mount on a staircase ( or hallway ) . the led lights are adjustable up and down . there are two light banks , and each can be adjusted independently.it runs on 3 aa batteries . the battery door is the only significant negative i 've found with this light . it 's a bit flimsy . it works fine for the moment , but i would imagine that it will be the first thing to fail down the road and require some tape to keep it in position.the light can be mounted using screws that fit into keyhole slots on the back of the light , or mounted using velcro pads ( both options are included ) . i went the velcro route since i mounted this on wood , plus i wanted it to be easy to remove to replace the batteries . the screw route is probably the better option if you 're mounting this on drywall.i 'm using rechargeable batteries in it without any problems ( amazon basics brand ) .the sensor works very well . i have it positioned so that it is triggered when i step onto the first step of the staircase . the light output is bright and ample . perfect for the early morning or evening to highlight the cats that have positioned themselves as speed bumps on the stairs.works well , and i would certainly recommend this if you need some additional automated lighting for a staircase or hallway .

> reading more like a first draft of a cable-tv movie , authors tim lahaye and greg dinallo pen an incredibly disjointed thriller which features an implausible plot and incredibly wooden characters.the main character - biblical prophecy scholar michael murphy - may not be the typical super-hero that plagues the action genre , but his world tour while escaping the clutches of evil is comical at best . the settings could be anywhere - from dubai to dubuque - and fails to provide any solid background material to give the reader any sense of substance . in one scene , he seemingly just plops into a hole in the ground and - with the help of his wife - quickly finds an ancient artifact.it is also a huge stretch the way the action is propelled by a shadowy group of thugs bent on world domination , an ice-cold killer and a media mogul who lacks any morals . the linkage of the domestic `` terror '' reaped upon the nation by these folks is somehow tied into a vast conspiracy against evangelical christianity , which is a ridiculous thread within the main plot.the most believable scenes are murphy 's class lectures , though his sniping about an antagonist within the college hierarchy is an unprofessional stunt that takes away from the message the authors are attempting to convey . yes , in this case , it is wise to attend the lectures , but get friends together for a football game on the quad for the rest of this dud .

> after ordering several , expensive humidifiers that only lasted a short time , i decided to try a simple design . this humidifier is exactly that . puts out a good volume of cool mist . no learning curve . just fill it up and turn it on . my only nit is that you have to hold the container the entire time you are filling it up . since it is curved , you ca n't set it down to fill it up .

> roth defines life outside the gates of chicago with & # 34 ; allegiant. & # 34 ; wanting the factions back , tris 's friends form the & # 34 ; allegiant & # 34 ; to go up against the factionless and evelyn . a handful of loyal supporters are picked to venture past the gates and find out what 's outside , but are the answers what the allegiant hope they will be ? tris , tobias , and their friends go past the gates and discover a community of geneticists living in the old remains of o'hare airport . there they come to understand the purity war and the important of having pure genes . it 's one shock after another as tris and tobias realize the extent of lies and manipulation regarding the inner city where they grew up . can they save the community from a memory erase or will the lies in the name of genetics continue ? roth 's writing is easy to read , however the book 's narrative is told switching between tris and tobias . unfortunately , tobias ' character voice sounds an awful lot like tris , leaving the reader uncertain at times as to whose point of view the story is being told from . i often found myself double-checking the chapter heading to see which character was narrating.the plot moves well and there 's plenty of twists and turns . the characters are achingly human in this haunting dystopian society . tobias possesses inner strength , but is tormented by the violence he 's encountered . tris is strong-willed , yet vulnerable when it comes to four.allegiant offers explanations that helps tris to understand her world . the best part of the novel is the ending - in the aftermath of war , we all still have to pick up the pieces and live . allegiant is a satisfactory ending to the series and will resonate with readers long after they 've put the book down .

> i 'll confess up front to only drinking this coffee a few times a year , and i do so more as a ritual than because i enjoy flavored coffees.first , the coffee itself : the beans used in this grind are 100 % arabica , so there is a characteristic smoothness . the flavor of the coffee itself is not particularly deep or rich , but the chocolate and other flavorings result in a nice brew of overall flavor and richness.i do enjoy how the flavor and coffee are balanced . neither overpowers the other . this has been skillfully blended to have all of the ingredients complement one another , which is why i gave it five stars.aside from the beans the package claims natural and artificial flavors . i am always on the lookout for nutritional issues with ingredients , but the packaging was vague about what exactly constitutes what are listed as artificial flavors . a check of a third party site devoted to nutrition info had zeros all the way down the list of values , including cholesterol and fat . that is encouraging , and especially considering that if the flavorings contained lactose or other allergens they would probably have been noted.bottom line regarding the beverage : i enjoy it , but not enough to habitually drink it . my biggest pleasure comes from the memories . my departed soulmate loved this coffee and the aroma of it brewing and the many cups i shared with her evoke priceless memories that are made more vivid when i smell the aroma of it brewing and sip a cup . i have a cup on her favorite holidays ( thanksgiving and christmas ) , and on her birthdays and anniversary of her passing . i am enjoying a cup as i write this and dedicate this review to the memory of karen i. karr november 1 , 1953 - april 12 , 2010 .

> what is most interesting about tori amos is how she never fears honesty and almost goes beyond revelation into the territory of inviting you into her inner heart where a stunning intimacy mingles with musical exploration . her disarming lyrics are often veiled in almost innocent musical style , making her deliciously enticing.i must admit , she looks very much like her real name : myra ellen on this album cover , which i love.tori amos ' sophisticated writing style is highly appealing although she seems to maintain a child-like beauty with her sweet silky voice . she seems to turn her life experiences into art painted in soft dreamy lyrics ( winter ) and then honest and soul-baring questions ( god ) .her voice can be whispery and sexy ( way down/baker baker ) and then almost scandalously rough ( professional widow ) . tori amos is difficult to categorize and i think she likes it that way . playful and child-like in mr. `` zee-ber-a '' she pronounces words any way she wants . `` baker baker baking a cakemake me a daymake me whole againand i wonder what 's in a daywhat 's in your cake this timei guess you heard he 's gone to l.a.he says that behind my eyes i 'm hidingand he tells me i pushed him awaythat my heart 's been hard to find '' ~baker bakeras far as i can tell from this album , tori amos ' heart is on display in this musical book of her thoughts . snow cherries from france is a sweet ending to an album that takes a journey through an artist 's mind.~the rebecca review

> the amazon reviewer promises more than this cd delivers ( leaving aside the risible claim that ashkenazy was `` the dominant chopin interpreter of his generation '' - send a telegram to pollini , argerich , ohlsoon , and moravec ) . i lived through all these years and owned ashkenazy 's lps of the ballades and scherzos . to call him a great chopin interpreter would require you to value conventionality and lack of personality far more than i do.leaving one 's expectations aside , this is certainly assured if low-key playing . ashkenazy was the first soviet expat to make his home in the west , so he roughly parallels nureyev in dance . the world already knew of gilels and richter , who tower over ashkenazy , but they appeared infrequently and were strongly committed soviet artists . now that we have a string of astonishing russian virtuosos on tap , ashkenazy 's light has rather faded . i would defy anyone to listen to any performance on this cd blind and recognize who the pianist is . nothing can be objected to , but nothing is exciting , either.as for those who claim that the young ashkenazy was `` white hot , '' i detect the same middle-of-the-road sensibility that he has displayed as pianist and conductor for five decades . if one had to choose , however , his account of the four scherzos shows more passion and freedom than the ballades . i 'd rank them among his best chopin .
= reliable , conventional pianism that is short on personality

> i have mixed feelings about this product . it offers a few benefits , but none are really compelling reasons to justify the cost.the best-functioning feature is the ability to use it as a usb flash drive . works well , although it is not the fastest drive i 've used . not a slow-poke , but no speed demon either . but , you can pick up a usb drive in the same size for a fraction of the cost , and also get one that is a lot less bulky.the backup power feature is a nice idea , but the amount of power it offers ( in terms of run time ) is not all that great . it 's ok for an ipod , but i was only able to get about 10 minutes of run time on an iphone . i suppose it could be a good item to have for that emergency phone call that you have to make when your battery is low/dead , but other than that , it 's not of significant use.if you remember to bring it along and keep it charged , it could be a handy gadget to have in an emergency . given the price , however , i do n't see it being a good value .

> a dick francis fan from the starting gate , shattered was a bit on the low side . plenty of fast action , nice guy hero , a romance and the baddies with an intriguing profession for the hero.most francis 's have racing twined among the spooks and this one is no different when the owner , the trainer , the jockey and his friend arrive at the racetrack for disaster . martin stukely , the jockey dies after having made a videotape of fixed races . gerard logan , a glass blower by profession , was the last person to have the tape.and the hunt is on for the villeins to recover the tape and gerard to stay alive long enough to find the missing tape and a killer . a page turner with flaws , but then that is why dick francis was awarded a grand mastership by mystery writers of america . his low hits are better than the highs of lesser authors.nash black , author of sins of the fathers and qualifying laps .

> i had a lot of fun with this edition of the conversation cards . the questions are thought provoking and can open up some very interesting dialogue between partners or in groups of couples . great for getting to know each other 's values.like any type of question and answer game you need to know your audience and use common sense . if you are playing with your partner and one of you had an affair that the relationship is still recovering from then do n't read the `` have you ever cheated on a lover ? '' card . some cards just are n't going to be up your alley but those are few and far between for most couples . this can be a really fun game as long as you do n't insist on reading every card no matter who it 's to or whose around . if playing the gourmet food edition with a recovering alcoholic you would n't use the question about wine would you ?

> i 'm not going to comment much on the contents . other reviewers have adequately praised it as a superb translation . instead , i just want to quickly remark on the cover . it shows allied soldiers landing at normandy during world war 2. driving home the point to the modern reader about the timeless appeal of the iliad . the struggles it describes will be relevant as long as wars continue to be fought.the cover choice was inspired . it differs from the traditional depictions of the original war , that you might perhaps see on other translations of the iliad . this cover is meant to be jarring and to make you realise that this is not just dusty poetry from a long dead society of the bronze age . at a deeper level , the photo from normandy also evokes the titanic struggle of world war 2 , underpinning the seminal magnitude of the trojan war for its contemporaries .
= inspired choice of cover

> powerful , gripping , harrowing , emotionally involving ; this book grabs you and does n't let up . the story revolves around a singer/protester who becomes prisoner in a squalid burmese prison . the conditions are obviously bad , and the treatment of the prisoner is humiliating , and connelly 's descriptions vividly illustrate these things . and that 's actually the only criticism , if you can call it that , i have about this book . too often the writing falls victim to the stereotypes of what life in prison is like ... or what people assume it to be like . it 's bad . i get it . but i think hammering the point over and over is just redundant . but overall , this is a book that needs to be read , by anyone with an interest in this fascinating southeast asian country , or just about the human condition .

> do n't get me wrong . i liked both films , just do n't think they make that good of combination , particularly if neither of the plotlines is that well developed.story in brief : jason huard ( james franco ) made a promise to his mom before she died that he 'd go to annapolis . he did n't quite fit in , but persistence pays off -- particularly if you ask your congressman 34 times for a recommendation.once he gets into annapolis , it seems the one thing huard has going for him is his ability to box . whether that will keep him in the school remains to be seen.if you liked `` rocky '' and `` officer '' , you might like this film , but there 's neither enough boxing or military training and discipline in the story to make it truly stand out.rebecca kyle , january 2009

> director danny boyle ( `` trainspotting '' , `` the beach '' ) has developed a magical fable of a film where two boys are literally struck with a bouncing bag of millions of dollars . damian is the younger of the two boys and has hilarious visions and conversations with his favorite saints . his plan is to give the money to the poor . his older brother , anthony has different plans . the clincher is , these are british pounds and the country is about to switch to euros in a few days , making them worthless . between the boy 's adventures in their fort , the police looking for the money and a robber that is closing in on the boys , director boyle never loses that human touch or sense of fantasy . it 's a fun film with no pretense .

> with britain in the pit of the second war , playwright coward was desperate to do a morale-boosting film , and `` serve '' was the inspired result . the normally effete coward is appropriately `` stiff upper lip '' as kinross , and a young mills stands out in a first rate ensemble cast which also includes bernard miles and celia johnson as coward 's wife . ( also look fast for a young richard attenborough ! ) with coward at the helm as writer , star , and even score composer , david lean handling most of the directing ( and all the editing ) , and future director ronald neame the cinematography , the result is one of britain 's very finest war films , which accomplished everything coward set out to do for his country .

> this is a revised review after going back to the book and finishing it : it is glaringly clear on nearly every single page of this book that mr. brown did a tremendous amount of research , which is why this book does not have the fast pace of his earlier novels . i found myself skipping page after page of minute detail about florence and its various pieces of historic art and after first putting it down in frustration , managed to pick through the rest of it to finish the book . overall , the plot is good ... but you have to work hard to find it .

> curiosity drove this viewer to see borat : cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan . especially when the golden globe nominations pegged both the film and the star as candidates for potential honors ! ! ! ! and though many very fine reviewers find this film worthy of praise , the response after viewing the piece in a theater packed with people howling with laughter - again , for this viewer - was one of being appalled.comedy is an art , an art that magnifies human foibles and allows a different viewpoint to make even sad aspects of life appear humorous . dark comedy can be cruel when the writing is acerbically witty and smart . what borat seems to have done is costume and scene change a standup comedy routine bent on grossing out its audience and choosing a demeaning manner instead of a parody to lash out at the multiple groups it attacks , be those the people of kazakhstan , pentecostal holiness churches , drunk sexist/racist teenagers , feminists , businessmen , actors , jews , homosexuals , rodeo folks , genteel southerners , tv talk show hosts/weathermen , etc.production wise the filming is crude , the storyline is plotted to look as though it were spontaneous candid camera takes ( yet credits a long list of writers including cohen ) , and the flatline character of borat is as predictable as the potty mouth humor it accompanies . but apparently the public wants this type of entertainment on the screens : the film is raking in millions for the effrontery of sacha baron cohen . have we really arrived at a state where our choices range from comic book hero flicks to gory slasher flicks to the base , crude , and thoughtless antics of extended comedy hour routines ? food for thought , but this viewer is obviously in the tiny minority . grady harp , december 06

> this is only the second book of the fool 's gold series that i 've read , aftertwo of a kindbut i am in love with this little california town and its quirky inhabitants.isabel is just in fool 's gold temporarily ( so she says ) running the family bridal shop before she heads out to find her fortune in new york city . for years she wrote to ford , starting when she was a 14 year old girl while he was in the military and he clung to her letters to ground himself and get himself back home . so when the opportunity arises to `` pretend '' to be boyfriend/girlfriend , both isabel and ford do n't resist much.i love stories that make me laugh - and cry - and this series seems to have found the right formula to have me doing both.i love the characters , the setting , all the side stories , the sexy romps ( and be forewarned they are pretty graphic ) . i 'm off to readall summer long ( fool 's gold ) next .

> i know , i 'm a guy . but i like my chest shaved for when i go swimming . i was tired of taking a bic to it and decided to try epilating . and , wow , it hurt ! but it was nice and smooth , too . plus , the hair did n't start growing back as fast , so i did n't have to tend to it as often as i did with the razor . subsequent uses hurt also , but as i use it more and more it has become more comfortable . either that or i 'm just getting more use to the pain ; i still do n't consider it a highlight of my month by a long shot , but it does the job.if you are looking for an epilator , i 'd suggest this one . i do hope they can come up with less painful ones in the future and will be keeping an eye out for newer models .

> this was the second hard rock scorpions release . the first is the more psyh rock flavored 'lonesome crow ' . this one is more accessible and has the classic song 'speedys coming ' . the rest are more hendrix inspired and the band had yet to get it 's true bearings . the next release would see that change into a fully modern metal style that was the scorpions own . gone would be the long psych rockers like 'fly to the rainbow ' and instead the hot guitar driven sounds of what would really be modern metal would come to the fore . this is still good early metal though and a must for any scorps fan . casual fans who are not psych rock fans might enjoy the groups catalog after this one though . but if you give it a chance you will find a great cd of well crafted and sung songs in the early metal / early 1970 's style of hard rock .

> as with any novel about jeeves and wooster , i do n't want to give too much away . much of the humor is not just in the language but in how surprisingly complex things can get before they are resolved . so my first suggestion is to skip the introduction by alexander cockburn who quotes some of the funnier scenes in the book.now as for the story it involves a cow-creamer , a small leather book , two marriages , a want-to-be dictator and a police helmet.the code of the woosters has 222 pages of some of the best dry british humor ever to come from p.g . wodehouse 's pen . as always the dialogue between bertie wooster and his man jeeves is some of the greatest you will ever encounter in your whole life . how one book can contain so much is beyond me but this is , as any of his books are , a must for any library .

> orlando bloom plays a blacksmith who has tragically lost his family and then is persuaded to fight in the crusades by his father , who is played by liam neeson . unfortunately , after neeson dies , the quality of the acting goes down throughout the film . the `` holy '' war is fought with the usual bloody battle scenes , and the characters neatly divided into good and evil ( some on both sides ) for which hollywood is famous . the film has action , a love interest , fairly accurate history , but unfortunately not much heart . the leading characters are never engaging enough to cause the viewer to really care about the outcome , and thus the movie becomes lots of sound and fury . the one point that it does make is that nothing much has changed in 1000 years -- christians and muslims are still fighting over control of the holy land .
= the crusades , as fought on the wide screen
< the `` holy land ''

> i really enjoy books that keep me up late at night , avidly turning pages to read as much of the story as i can before sleep overtakes me . this book is one of those kinds of reads , and i thoroughly enjoyed it ! there are actually two distinct plotlines in the book , both important , and running on parallel tracks throughout . the hero is faced with what appears to be nefarious deeds done behind his back by his own company 's officials and board members , and then there is the stalker , whose death fuels most of the excitement . i 'm not one to give away plots , or even little hints , but i will say that the tension on both tracks heats up constantly , until the ultimate explosion and ending . if only all thriller writers could be this good , i 'd probably never get enough sleep !

> i love my kindle book ! i can review any book available before i buy it . the speed of downloading is faster than i would have imagined . i am still learning to use the features , but it has made reading much easier for me . i really appreciate the ability to make the print larger since my eyesight is not the best . the only downside i find is that the battery does n't last more than about 3 hours before i need to recharge it . nevertheless , it is lighter to carry around than most books . and , best of all , the cost of the books are usually less than $ 10.00 .

> i was impressed with the usefulness of this case . my wife and i are often in situations where rain , splashing water , or dust could damage our cellphones . i tried using the case with my wife 's iphone 4 , which is in an otterbox commuter series case , and there was ample space . it was easiest to press the power switch on the iphone if i inserted the phone upside down , which works best anyway if you put the case 's lanyard around your neck . i was also able to insert my samsung smartphone , which is a bigger phone with a bulkier case , although it was a snug fit.i scuba dived with cameras in underwater housings for many years , and i have a good idea how watertight seals work . on this case , the seals appear to be well designed , but frankly , i doubt if i would intentionally risk an expensive phone underwater . accidents happen , and even the tiniest opening will allow water to enter , and it only takes a couple of drops in the wrong place to damage electronics . i see the waterproof case being most useful as protection for a phone at the beach , water parks , boating , rafting , or anywhere where water or dust could potentially damage a phone.overall , i give the case high marks for the design and construction quality . the neck lanyard keeps your phone handy when you need it , a nice touch . i was n't sure if the clear windows would work with a phone 's touchscreen , but the screen responded well to touches and swipes.a product sample was provided by the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review . the manufacturer stated that the case design has been updated to eliminate some problems that earlier reviews had noted .

> ian mcewan is an extraordinary author . his characterizations and his writing cadence are extraodinary . this book was really not what i expected . i was expecting a spy thriller book with earth-shattering and catastrophic segments . there is nothing life-threatening or dangerous about this book even though the element of surprise and the fear of the unexpected are both there for the reader . i have to admit that serena frome was probably one of the most unlikeable protagonists that i 've ever read . she was very well portrayed and that is not why i did n't like her . she is just not a woman that i would be drawn to at all if i was to meet someone like her . she vacillates and ca n't seem to make a decision to save her life . she 's insincere and a bit of a snob actually . she moves through her life and her main goal is to make no waves , stand for nothing and just drift . having said that , i found the minor characters in the book were wonderful and very real . i especially liked serena 's sister and father . although we do n't see them much in the book , i found them very easy to picture and imagine . there 's a lot about love , desire , deceit , creativity ( in the form of the written word ) . without giving away anything of the plot , there is even an evil character . a character that does n't loom that large in the narrative , but one whose deception is actually behind the whole story . mcewan does such a good job of laying bare human deceptions and exposing all the cracks and breaks under the gloss of the human facade . it seems to come up and hit you as you read his books .

> this is so incredibly clever ! i received this unit for review , and was surprised how easily it worked . the unit fits on a water bottle ( i used arrowhead , and it fit perfectly ) , which it uses to make a cold humidifier . it comes with two filters that fit in the water bottle ( i appreciate they gave me an extra filter ) .the unit works on a usb port , so , to keep the unit very portable , i just hooked it up to a small battery pack.as soon as it starts working , you can see a nice mist coming out of the top of the canister . it has a bluish tint from a light installed . this looks pretty amazing ... but would a small bottle like this change the air in my very dry desert home ? i put the unit next to the head of my bed , to see how i would sleep in the deserts very dry air , while using this.this morning i woke up without anything feeling very dry . however , this unit was within 6 & # 34 ; of my head.i would think the best way to use this would be on tighter spaces ( camping , car , etc . ) , or at your desk , plugged into your computers usb port.this is a very clever device that i will continue to use and update you on . thank you for , reading my review . : ) you can easily clean the nozzle with a bit of vinegar solution .

> an old chinese proverb states if you want a love in marriage , marry for a year . but if you want love that will last a life time , take up gardening . i did not read the book , so i do not really know why the author named his work the constant gardner , but i interpret the film as saying that ralph fiennes loved rachel weisz , the two stars in the show , with a love that is as strong as the gardener in the chinese proverb . however , another interpretation of the title may be that while rachel , a lawyer-activist in kenya , is very active in her pursuit involving people , ralph , a british government official , is somewhat passive , and although certainly loving rachel , is generally uninvolved with people and more interested in his gardening . whether i am right or wrong , the interpretations i give to the title , i think , captures some of the main characteristics of this fine film.without divulging the intricacies of the plot , it focuses on the fact that rachel is found shot to death . this awakens ralph , who feels remorse for not knowing what rachel was involved in , and bothered by rumors of her infidelity , decides to find out everything about her and who killed her . he discovers a far-reaching high-level conspiracy , far more complex than he ever imagined .

> i 've seen much back and forth in the reviews about whether or not this product has high/low/strobe settings or just on/off . the reports of one over the other do n't seem be be correlated to the date of purchase ( i.e . it does n't seem as if they started , or stopped , including the adjustment features at some point in the past ) . i 've watched the video review . i 've used other adjustable torches in the past . i know how the feature works if it 's there . mine does not do anything except turn on and off . i think it just comes down to dumb luck and what they happen to have in stock in hong kong at the time of purchase . would i like a low-beam feature to save battery ? absolutely ! am i appalled i did n't get it in my seven buck flashlight ? no , i 'm not . the brightness is comparable to flashlights costing 10x as much . it 's bright , adjustable focus , solid metal , and runs on common aa batteries . it 's a great buy . i also got some 2.7v rechargeable batteries and it 's noticeably brighter with them , but not world-changing in my opinion . at this price i plan to buy a few more so i can stash them in drawers throughout the house .

> john 's classic christmas album wasrocky mountain christmas , but only about half of that album is featured on this compilation . i know that rocky mountain christmas has previously been released on cd , but i did n't buy it . this compilation includes two tracks fromchristmas like a lullaby ( which i also own ) , two tracks froma christmas together , four tracks fromchristmas in concertand one from a very early album of john 's , whose garden was this.it does at least retain my favorite songs from rocky mountain christmas ( please daddy do n't get drunk this christmas , christmas for cowboys ) . of the tracks not appearing here , some appear here in a different guise ( via the version from christmas in concert ) while four very familiar classics have been dropped altogether , these being rudolph the red nosed reindeer , silver bells , away in a manger and silent night . despite their omission , there are still a fair number of obvious classics here.so i like this compilation despite the misleading title . if you particularly want the actual classic john denver christmas album , you must look for a copy of rocky mountain christmas . nevertheless , i imagine most people will be very happy with this collection .

> mio mango peach comes in a handy dental-floss looking bottle , and has 24 servings in a bottle . basically you squirt some in plain water , and this enhances the water with a semi-artificial peach/mango taste . it also seems to contain food-color , since it tints the water a light peach color.i was curious to try mango peach mio , but i confess it really is n't something i care to repeat . the drink does enhance the water with a semi-fake artificial peach taste , but i confess i prefer my water straight and without the extra fake-flavoring and acid.while the taste was appealing , i do n't need the extra chemicals or food dye in my diet , and as the main ingredients are : water and malic acid and contains zero fruit juice , you are n't really getting anything healthy here . i also found the ingredients in this drink mix irritating to my bladder , so those with painful bladder syndrome should be aware this drink contains acid.if you like artificial drinks of the crystal light variety , this might appeal to you . for me , while the idea was innovative , i would like it to be more healthy to consume and without the food dye and acidity .

> is not the same as being grand . the first anime , made for tv , had great music , characters and artwork . the only failure was the plot - as the manga was not near the completion the anime had to go out and make its own ending.now the manga is almost complete and this anime plans to follow the plot . but the artwork sometimes seems wooden , the music is no where near as good and some lines are just not needed . why would sir hellsing call arucard a `` count '' ? why hit us over the head with that fact ? if you are a fan you know who arucard is and if you are not , well , thanks a lot for giving it away ! at 50 minutes a dvd there will have to be 9 or 10 dvds just to cover the basic plot . no extras but some trailers . sad . not worth the money . buy used .

> with a sound reminiscent of costello 's work from the early 80 's , brutal youth just misses the level of his better material . by using the attractions ( w/nick lowe in place of bruce thomas on many cuts ) costello reaches back for a sound ; a sound that he does n't completely capture . the songs are often clever without the depth of passion that a listener comes to expect from costello and the music , while solid , seems just too busy to capture the attention . there are cuts worth hearing ( `` 20 % amnesia , '' `` this is hell , '' `` rocking horse road '' ) but the misses ( `` my science fiction twin , `` sulky girl '' ) are just as common . not a bad cd , just disappointing .

> had `` i am nujood , aged 10 and divorced '' been historical fiction or fantasy or a grown woman 's memoir of her childhood , i would say it is fantastically written . `` i am nujood , aged 10 and divorced '' is a true story , written by delphine minoui , an adult and nujood ali , who is still a child . obviously , the actual writing is done by minoui , as ali has not had much schooling . ali 's voice is in first person , but that is where i find myself distracted . in the child 's words , i hear the voice of an adult . her observations too keen , more wise than her years , more educated than her one year of schooling would allow . sometimes , she briefly mentions religion or culture as a way to educate readers about the context of the situation but yet immediately professes her ignorance . she can not be ignorant and knowing at the same time . minoui would have done better to write from the child 's perspective and intersperse that with a third person narrative when attempting to educate the reader about the religious , political and social issues . for these distracting lapses , i subtract one star.the story itself is very interesting . i remember reading of ali 's plight in the papers . in the book , she tells how she was wed and what that was like , how she decided to leave and the manner in which she escaped ( it was fascinating ) and what happened afterwards . i learned many details i did not know about from the media . the time frame of her story is quite short , less than a year , and the book is able to maintain focus.ali is a courageous young little girl , the first girl ever to win a divorce in her country , and i hope her life brings her much deserved happiness .

> i feel unworthy writing a review of this work , but i was so impressed with it that i feel moved to do so . i had been putting off reading this book for years , simply due to its volume -- over 1100 tightly packed pages . but believe me , anyone who wants to understand how ww2 came to be , and what the nazis were all about , should read this one.william shirer was a journalist in europe during most of the third reich 's duration , and his first-hand experience with the major figures of the era give this book a wonderful , authentic feel . this is not a dull work of scholarship ( as i had feared ! ) it is a priceless well-written and thorough history of the third reich . shirer himself notes that perhaps a better history could be written 50-100 years following the war , with the benefit of detached perspective . however , this book proves that the opposite is also true -- had shirer not written this book we might never have had the opportunity to read a thorough work on this topic by one who observed much of the actual events and who saw and met many of the key figures of the third reich.neville chamberlain springs to life as one of the most craven politicians ever . other figures of the time are vividly portrayed . after completing this book i felt that i had a much better understanding as to why the sellout at munich , and world war ii in general , have had such a profound effect upon the politics of the modern era -- not merely because of the horrific death and destruction that the war entailed , but because of the tragically bad decisions that resulted in the war itself.anyone who wants to understand the european portion of ww2 should read this book . and a great read it is .

> steel cut oats seem to be the 'in ' thing this year , though i have been eating them for years . i love oatmeal on a cold winter 's morning , or a cool or hot morning for that fact . the oats are sufficient enough to give us a great start on the day . nutritious and delicious.bob 's red mill oats steel cut , won the best roasting steel , cut oats contest in cooking light , and in many households . i have tried mccanns and the lower cost bargain brands . nothing compares to the nutty taste of bob 's red mill oats steel cut . the easiest method to have a dish of oatmeal waiting for you in the morning is to make it the night before.here 's how.1 . the night before : put oats with a pinch of salt in a dry heavy covered pot over medium heat ; toast the oats until you just are aware of their fragrance , swirling or stirring periodically . meanwhile , put the requisite amount of water in a kettle and bring to a boil . then pour the boiling water over the oats , cover and turn off the heat . let stand over night.2 . when you rise , you can add dried fruit as desired and bring quickly to a boil again and turn off the heat and let sit . reheat briefly when you are ready to eat them.i prefer my oatmeal with brown sugar and milk . however , for a more luxurious oatmeal , try roasting the oats with a tablespoon of butter . roast until you smell the nutty fragrance . then , proceed as above . with this kind of porridge i add maple syrup . yum , yum ! highly recommended . prisrob 01-11-14

> like kurosawa 's `` rashomon '' ( which is actually based on another novella `` in a grove '' ) , the story of `` dagon '' is in fact closer to that of `` the shadow over innsmouth '' though the original 's plotline about a hapless traveler is considerably changed . loosely based on two h.p . lovecraft works , a 2001 spanish horror film may disappoint the author 's fans , but as a slick b-horror flick `` dagon '' manages to deliver the goods.directed by stuart gordon of `` re-animator '' fame , the story of `` dagon '' revolves around a young billionaire paul marsh ( ezra godden ) having a vacation with his girlfriend barbara ( raquel mero & ntilde ; o ) in spain on their friend 's boat . when a storm arrives , they head for a nearby seaside village `` imboca , '' where he is attacked by a group of strange-looking residents.set in modern-day spain , this is not a very faithful lovecraft adaptation , but still is a surprisingly enjoyable ride . acting is at best so-so , though i found macarena g & oacute ; mez 's `` dream girl '' pretty impressive . also , i wanted to see more people with the `` innsmouth look , '' and was not much impressed with the protagonist 's one-liners , but except the weak ( and thankfully brief ) introduction , the film maintains the creepy atmosphere . `` dagon '' is a decent horror movie that is entertaining , but also makes us want to see a more authentic version of `` the shadow over innsmouth '' set in massachusetts , and hopefully with a bus .

> at first , i was a tiny bit skeptical . `` a young adult book ? '' i thought . `` i 'm 32 -- can it hold my attention ? challenge me ? impress me with its writing ? make me feel deeply ? `` as it turned out , the answer to all four questions was a resounding `` yes . '' it was a bit of a slow start with the hyper-intrusive narrator ( reminiscent for me of hawthorne , and the reason i took off a star ) , but once the story got rolling and the narrator stepped back , i was engrossed , forced to think , charmed with language , and even teared up on two occasions.so much has already been said rightfully praising this book that i 'll keep it to two specific comments : like the simpsons and pixar movies , this book can appeal to the young with its authenticity of childhood portrayal , but it also slips in serious observations for readers of all ages . secondly , his descriptions and figures of speech were unique and thought-provoking ; no one since neal stephenson has impressed me so much for sheer joy of lex . just a few examples : '' his teeth were like a soccer crowd , crammed in . `` `` the smell of dust and theft loitered in the background . `` `` a rumor of sunshine stood behind the clouds .

> do you like the game apples to apples but think it is to tame or politically correct ? do you constantly try to turn it into a more & # 34 ; adult & # 34 ; game ? are you generally a horrible person with an inappropriate sense of humor ? then get this game ! i like to think i am a good , wholesome person , but i still love this game . i have played it with a very large group of people during a game night . everyone was cracking up laughing the whole time , we went through every card in the box , and it was the only game we played that night . there were people crying because they were laughing so hard . some people actually apologized because of the cards they were playing . that is a good sign that it is a horribly hilarious game . i ended up buying a couple of the expansion packs so we would have plenty for next time.for real though , if you do n't find & # 34 ; potty humor & # 34 ; or politically incorrect jokes funny , do n't get this game . also , do n't play it with your grandmother . either she wo n't get half of it , or you will be too embarrassed about the fact that she does get it to really want to play anymore .

> a bomb explodes in the vienna office of a hunter of german war criminals.thus is & quot ; art restorer and sometime spy gabriel allon & quot ; drawn into a search for a repulsive former german officer , sadist , torturer and killer.if the story were n't based on an actual human disaster of massive magnitude , it would be more enjoyable . instead , to be reminded of the millions cold-bloodedly murdered by the german nation and its allies is depressing.but silva writes a suspense filled novel of allon 's search . the characters are richly human . they are not supermen ; they are humans seeking justice in an unjust world . even for crimes that happened a half-century , their passion to seek justice for the dead drives them to put their own lives at risk.silva 's plot never stops or falters . the action keeps pushing ahead , though the reader might find a need to take a break from the recounting of the gruesome deeds being avenged.the knowledge that the background events silva weaves into his story are , as noted , not the kind of things most people want to think about . but silva tells a story of long-delayed justice that we can all hope - or wish - takes place in venues outside of fiction.jerry

> the 5 love languages of children by gary d. chapman & ross campbell is another installment in chapman 's excellent love languages series . i 've read the book for couples and the one for teens , and both helped me understand my family much better . the premise is that each person has a primary love language ( the five being : physical touch , words of affirmation , acts of service , quality time , and gifts ) and to fully fill somone 's love tank , we need to speak their language . unfortunately , we all too often speak our own language fluently , but if that 's not the language of the child , they do n't feel loved and it leads to resentment on both sides . chapman does a wonderful job of giving examples of how to figure out your child 's love language as well as ideas for learning to speak it . there 's also information on discipline and handling anger . there is so much good parenting packed into this slim book ! since reading the book , i 've been able to understand my own children better , and i 've seen changes in them . these are lessons to be learned and clung to .

> keb ' mo 's 8th cd is a delightful winner . it follows `` slow down , '' `` keep it simple , '' & `` peace '' as his 4th # 1 blues cd . although `` slow down '' still ranks as his top charting cd on billboard ( # 109 ) , `` suitcase '' is so good that it will find its audience . while the entire cd is satisfying , my favorite 4 tracks begin with the bluesy `` the itch . '' mo ' bounces joyfully on the track and takes his case to the spirit in the sky , `` mother mary , father joe , i need to talk to your son . he had his troubles just like mine and he was the chosen one . '' my favorite track is the bouncy `` remain silent '' with the classic chorus , `` the truth will set you free , but the less you say , the better off you 'll be . '' mo ' goes classic on `` whole 'nutha thang '' with some dixieland riffs thrown in as he tends a classic theme , `` i do n't care much about cocaine & you 'll never see me jumping out no airplane ; wine & whiskey do n't give me no thrills & i do n't care 'nuthin 'bout them nasty little pills , but women , that 's a whole 'nutha thang . '' darrell leonard 's trumpet & joe sublett 's tenor sax stroke and sass the melody exquisitely . one of the slower tracks , `` i 'll be your water , '' ranks up with some of mo 's most emotionally touching music . the simple acoustic guitar backing his trembling voice , `` if you ever need a helping hand , i 'll be your ship out on the ocean ; i 'll be your water in the desert sand . '' the other tracks on the set are also consistently strong like `` still there for me '' & the title track . this is a delightful set that grows on you the more you listen . keb ' mo ' is one of blues ' best new acts . bravo !

> maybe i have deplorable tastes , but i liked branagh 's version of `` mary shelley 's frankenstein . '' in fact , i watched it twice in a row just to make sure . yep , despite the generally negative critical reviews of this film , i like this version of shelley 's immortal classic a lot.what sold me on `` frankenstein '' was the relative faithfulness to the spirit of the book . ( i say relative , because bringing a novel to the screen involves some necessary alteration . the two media are different . ) shelley 's hastily-written tale pits man and science against god and nature . surprise , surprise , man loses . branagh is believable as the obsessed and arrogant frankenstein who stops at nothing , risks everything to beat death . robert diniro is absolutely the most true frankenstein 's monster ever depicted on screen.the scene where frankenstein brings the monster to life is thrilling . the set looks right , the scheme of reanimation is brilliant . it 's my favorite scene in the film.there is a lot that is excessive and frankly over the top in the film , but to me that added to the nineteenth century feel and pacing . romantic literature can be huge -- because romanticism exaggerates and dramatizes the heroic and tragic . this film captures that sensibility.if you look at any of the other attempts to film shelley 's novel , you might agree with me that they do n't come close to doing justice to the novel ( for example , the old black and white film , which is not one of my favorites , and the more recent flop `` the bride '' . ) this version comes very close , perhaps as close as a film can come to shelley 's masterpiece .

> gail caldwell is a pulitzer prize winner for writing book reviews for the boston globe . in this book , she looks back on growing up in texas and , perhaps more importantly , her relationship with her dad . `` a strong wind west '' ( 228 pages ) brings us the story of what it was like growing up in amarillo , texas in the 50s and 60s . gail was one of 2 daughters in the caldwell family , and she has a strong bond with her father , which eventually grows more troublesome as gail moves away to college , first in lubbock , then later in austin . for a while , it looks as if the author is going to focus ( too ) much on the anti-war , feminist movement of the late 60s and early 70s , but then she turns her attention to the many different family members , both past and present , and the author paints a complicated , yet compelling portrait , in particular how her relationship revolves over the years , ultimately finding peace again with her father , and for that this book ultimately makes a good read.particularly insightful is the author 's retelling of her academic experiences at austin , where she dropped out 8 weeks before graduating , only to take up the thread years later and to then go on and take a masters . her insights on how certain professors engaged her , or not , are really good . in the end , this is not a revelatory memoir , akin to frank mccourt 's tales in `` angela 's ashes '' and its sequels , but it still makes for an enjoyable book all around .

'' roy thomas baker 's spare production is gave the band a sharper focus , and made the songs leap from the speakers with a fresh sound.the band 's arsenal was well loaded . greg hawkes brought keyboards to the front of the band , as well as his sax work . elliot easton made his choppy guitar work as fluid as it was jittery , and ben orr and ric ocasek switched vocals just enough that , while there was variety , it was seamless . true originals , the cars were often aped but never replicated ( as opposed to the dozens of joe jackson/elvis costello copycats ) and it makes this debut sound great almost 25 years after it was released .

> this book is an insightful look at relationships between sisters . tannen interviewed over one- hundred women and spoke to them about various aspects of their relationships with their sisters . she frequently tells stories about her relationship with her own sisters . she is the youngest of three sisters . she focuses a great deal on conversation as major research resource . she in the course of her analysis explains the special pleasures of closeness between sisters , while also examining the particular nature of competitive conflicts between them . she writes in a straightforward clear way and the work is rich in anecdote . the book is very insightful and i learned much not only about relations between sisters , but also about other family relationships . tannen as a child , a third child told her parents that they obviously were more important to her than she to them because there was only one of them while she had two other sisters . the book does not excel in humor but it is richly informative .one of deborah tannen 's majorgoals is to help her readers improve their familial relationships and my guess is that this work provides understanding that could help this be true in many cases .

> this was a disturbing reading experience . when candy spelling did n't make me totally bored with her ramblings , she totally offended me with her narcissistic outlook on life . i 've never met this lady , but i 'm sure this is the kind of woman who makes herself the center of every conversation -- or else ! i had no feeling one way or the other on candy or her daughter , but now i feel completely sympathetic to tory spelling . what a sad way to grow up ... no matter how much money flowed in and out of that household.save yourself the money , and instead hang out with the most annoying person you know for a few hours . it 'll add up to just about the same as reading this book .
= an uncomfortable read .

> i would have liked a different actor as the mentor to the panda in this movie , but it was still a fair amount of fun and a good message . i was a bit disappointed in dreamworks casting . most families will enjoy it . the one voice that truly did n't seem to quite fit was dustin hoffman 's . no offense to him but we needed someone who could have called jack black 's panda , grasshopper . david carradine would have been good in that role . some may find hoffman 's high pitched complaints funny , it just did n't strike me that way . it is a fairly entertaining movie for the family . good quality dvd with decent replayablity . if you enjoyed this catch `` mulan '' .ca luster

> i used to always watch this show . i loved it , and i loved jarod . it was always entertaining and while each episode mainly stood on its own , there was the mystery behind jarod 's past that made me keep watching . i 'd say now that it 's a little dated , but if you 've never seen this before or even if you have , it is still enjoyable and well written . now everyone will know james denton ( jamie denton then ) from desperate housewives . he was a hot looking bad guy , and miss parker is now in less than perfect . it 's a good cast ( with not always great acting ) but you 'll enjoy it if you like a bit of mystery .
= i used to love this show .

> if you know what the title of my review means , then you 've seen the movie . and you know it is good : adventure , action , escape , burdens , lost loves , and survival under harsh circumstances . this is a mix of robinson caruso and the count of monte cristo ( while dante is in prison ) .federal express manager chuck noland ( tom hanks ) is shipwrecked for four years . this story related to his life before , during , and after . and believe it or not , at the very end , i 'll bet you will be wondering about the next chapter as well.cast away is a movie investment ... you 'll want to see it about every third year .

> i own over a dozen lodge cast item pieces that i 've happily used for many years and recently purchased this one to add to my collection . immediately , i noticed this pan seemed thinner and `` cheaper '' made , than in the past . on the first use before heating , i noticed the pan bottom was warped upward in the center allowing oil and food to run to the edge . after 3-4 uses , i noticed the bottom center seemed to be deteriorating . after 5 uses , i noticed what seems to be a crack forming . now it will be thrown away . i 've never had a problem with lodge cast iron until now . very disappointed !

> this skillfully told tale of secrets , discoveries and , of course the mysteries of roswell , nm is full of mystery , talk of aliens , and scientific horrors that go back for decades.when faye allen was only ten years old , in 1947 , she sees what she believes to be an alien aircraft crash in roswell , nm , and sixty years later becomes the victim of a kidnapping when it is discovered that she has a piece of the wreckage . enter tyler locke , a former military combat engineer , who rescues faye and helps to discover the ugly truth behind her claims.the telling of this tale is blunt , full of action and imagination . the characters are strong , the men are manly , seasoned , and totally human heroes . faye is a charmer with her feisty attitude and the conviction that she is n't the 'crazy woman ' many believe , because what she has found could bring the united states to its knees if foreign entities succeed with their evil plans.boyd morrison has been compared to having a style like clive cussler with characters and plots that are larger than life ! i believe its true and think this is well worth the time to read ! tyler locke is a hero to enjoy , either by reading all of the series or selected books as stand alones.this edition was provided by netgalley in exchange for an honest review .

> wow ! intrigue , mystery and romance at it 's best . this is the 4th and last book in the star harbor series and ms. barrett has outdone herself . the grayson brothers are certainly delicious , and the series as a whole is a must read , but slow summer burn could stand alone if necessary.our hero , the 4th brother , is the strong silent type , but he really has depth and caught my emotions early . our heroine has an air of innocence despite her high-society upbringing . it was so easy to become emotionally engaged in this story of the love that should n't work . i was extremely satisfied by the happily ever after . the pacing was even , the story/mystery/romance well-plotted , the dialogue witty , the settings well drawn , the secondary characters engaging as well , and the sex ! the sex was hot , passionate , appropriate to the story , and wow , just wow , so satisfying.ms . barrett has given her readers yet another strong , steamy read . well done ! i look forward to what she has in store for us next . *i received my copy from netgalley.com in exchange for an honest review .

> what was i thinking reading this book . now i have to wait until october to read the second book . i 'm going to have a very hard time waiting . obviously i really liked this book . the writing was excellent , as well as the story . i saw very few similarities to fifty shades . eva in bared to you comes from money , takes control and has her own set of issues . gideon has issues too but is n't as controlling and can be very sweet . i thought this book was a bit more believable than 50. but you ca n't really say this book is a rip off of fifty shades because christian grey is n't the only f 'd up bazillionare out there in cont . erotic romance land . highly recommend this book . it was very easy to read and i read it so fast despite the 300+ pages .

> this is bill cosby , but this is not a comedy album . in 1971 he put out badfoot brown and the bunion bradfords funeral marching band , music he got inspired to write when martin luther king was murdered in 1968.the album has two tracks ; each took a side when this came on lp . these are basically open bluesy jams with some jazz flourishes . cosby was always a jazz fan and mentions miles , mingus and coltrane as inspiration in his notes . i ca n't find musician credits.on both tracks the structures are simple : long bluesy marches that sound as if they were recorded with an overhang mic . the audio has a strange lo-fi quality to it . but the playing is good.if you like endearingly sloppy jazz jamming albums , you 'll enjoy this .

> i wanted a refillable cup that brews under pressure . there is a utube video that shows someone putting a used kcup in a refilliable cup to make sure only one hole is at the bottom thus the coffee will be brewed under pressure . this will then have the same quality of a k cup . i was told this refillable has only a small hole at the bottom , and brews under pressure . it may brew under pressure , but it is just a small filter cup like all the others i have seen . further , an empty k cup want even fit in it , without cutting it in half.all that said , there may not even be a refillable k cup with only a small hole at the bottom i still have not found one

> among nikon 's most celebrated lenses have been its micro nikkor macro lenses . this autofocus lens remains among the best , not only for its fine optics but also because it will allow the user to focus down to a 1:1 life size reproduction ratio , which is perfect for photographing inanimate objects such as coins or stamps or relatively still living objects such as leaves and flowers . i agree with another reviewer that if you intend to photograph small animals such as insects , then either a 105mm micro nikkor or the 200mm f4 micro nikkor , would be a more appropriate macro lens . otherwise , the 60mm micro nikkor lens may be all the lens you need for superb closeup photography .

> it is n't cable , and it is n't satellite , but if you set up netflix and huluplus accounts ( others if you wish- which i do n't ) , you can easily have access to 90 % of the entertainment you are used to watching . let 's see- i was paying over $ 80+/month for the same programs . i will always treasure the moment i called satellite and told them to take their equipment and ... well - you get the idea . the streaming player is 3.5 inches by 3.5 inches x 1 inch . weighs 5 ounces . i had to buy an hdmi cable ( $ 5.00 ) to hook it into my tv , and wifi is a must . i also purchased a roku 3 totalmount universal mounting kit ( $ 15.00 ) . this beauty hides the player behind my tv- nothing for the eye to see , no clutter . it took me 5 minutes to hook it all up . i love that i can use the included in-ear headphones- they plug into the remote - if you are the night owl , you wo n't keep your partner awake . what else ? oh , you can app your smartphone into a remote . i never , ever , have to pay roku again . i gave them about $ 100- once- now i own it outright . get the roku 3. it 's worth the extra $ ( $ 100-ish ) . the set-up is so easy that you can move the device from one tv to another in less than 2 minutes . very limited commercial time . with some programs you have no commercial interruptions at all . you can pause , rewind , or use the remote for gaming . ( remote takes 2 aa 's ) after all the thousands of dollars i have surrendered to cable or satellite , this is a wonderful gift . i do not have any affiliation with this company . but i do wish i owned stock .

> friendship , motherhood , work , and marriage - how much do we truly know about those we love ? in the crazy world following 9/11 , washington dc based kate vacations with her husband chris and their two young children on great rock island , new england . like a lot of people kate struggles with her needs , the needs of her husband and children , and how to mingle them with her career as a pastry chef.kate inherits a trunk of journals , from her close friend elizabeth ( dating back to her teenage years ) who had died the year before in a plane crash aged 37 ! kate and elizabeth had much in common , both as wives and mothers . the journals reveal an almost parallel universe elizabeth to kate . kate is astounded by the extent of what she did n't know about her friend . this leads kate to question their friendship , the concepts of loyalty & honesty , and also her own marriage.it 's compelling story especially when you add to it that elizabeth 's husband wants to read the journals , he does n't know what his wife was doing or going the day she died . it 's also slow-moving , thought-provoking , and beautiful . not just for women , it does n't speak to all women but i recommend to any guy who is befuddled by the women in his life.i have been reading a lot of crime , non-fiction and romance so this was a anticipated & welcome treat.i wish i could pinpoint why it was a struggle to finish . because it is a by a debut novelist ? maybe i was expecting a book that would resonate with me 30 years from now and this did n't do it for me . it was however a nice weekend read and i will surely give the author 's next book a try .

> these numinous scriptures come close to rivaling james robinson 's edition of thethe nag hammadi libraryas the most important contribution to 20th century metaphysics . and not only for those who consider discordianism as a form - albeit a weird one - ofgnosticism.certain passages inspire more than others , like the enlightenment of zarathud and lord omar 's epistle to the paranoids of which only the orthodox version appears here . according to the samaritan codex ( jealously guarded by a heterodox discordianist cult ) and the octuagint there is an additional verse which reads : `` ye erect tall buildings , only to cast yerselves from the rooves . `` the same codex - but not the octuagint - also contains the epistle to the neurotics by st. euthanasius which regrettably did n't make it into this edition . for nearly 3000 years scholars have been debating its authenticity . the editors could at least have added it as an appendix.a welcome improvement over earlier editions is the inclusion of the variant reading of verse 4 of the epistle to the paranoids from the codex sinaiticus : `` o how the darknesses do crowd up , one against the other , in ye hearts ! what fear ye more than [ not `` that '' ] what ye have wroughten ? `` despite the aforementioned omissions , the familiar exegeses of the thoughts of eris , greek goddess of chaos , by malaclypse & omar continue to illuminate , enlighten and comfort millions . if you appreciate these insights , you will love the work ofrobert anton wilson .

> last summer i went and volunteered for some time with a scientist who had led one of the expeditions to siberia to recover a frozen mammoth . their intent was to see if the dna of the animal was still intact enough to enable a clone to be built ( grown , developed , whatever ) . while the meat was still 'fresh ' the dna was destroyed so no clone.this was enough , however to tempt me into this book . and his story of the digging up of the animal is very well told . his comments on digging in russia are exactly right , you ca n't take the animal or even sample tissue out of russia , etc . ) this story is , of course is science fiction ( which i like ) so he has expanded the story to move the mammoth to canada . and then built a story around an alien artifact . this part was a lot like arthur c. clarke 's 1948 story , 'the sentinel . ' which later became a novel and a movie under the name '2001 : a space odyssey . ' that is , an artifact burried where it ca n't be found is finally found and used to send a signal to an advanced species.the rest comes down to the tone of the story , the writing , the characters . not , i 'm afraid going to make it to the all time best , but a damn file read .

> i really enjoyed this movie . dare i say more than iron man . well it 's close . i 'll say for sure , for me , it 's much better than iron man 2. mark ruffalo is fantastic as bruce banner . he seems like the right fit with the character . out of all the people who have played the part he is the only one that reminds me of bill bixby , who i think is still the best banner but mark does a great job . each character had a fair amount of screen time , it 's not all just iron man which it could have easily turned into . robert downey jr. is so good that he leaves you wanting more . i each brought something to the table . the breakout star being the cgi hulk . for the first time in cgi hulks i was able to put aside the fact that he is pure simulation and concentrate on his personality . something that i feel was lost in the prior movies . his interactions with thor and loki was really good . the only one i did n't care too much for was captain america but i di n't care for his movie very much either . he grows on you after a while though . joss whedon did a awesome job and i look forward to avengers 2 .

> an april bride is the latest by lenora worth , and the latest in a year of weddings series . i enjoyed getting to know stella and marsh , but felt sorry for the pair with his brain injuries , and trauma from the war . stella was the practically perfect one in this book while marsh could n't even express his love . he truly was a hurting hero and something about him reminded me of someone in my former life that i feel blessed to be free from . maybe it was the way he worded things . i wanted to tell stella to run , fast and far.most of the book was about her trying to help him remember and assuring each other how committed they are to this wedding , even though he ca n't even remember her , and then a lot of misunderstandings about wanting to break up , and then they were married . the wedding was over.i do n't know how i feel . not warm and fuzzy , but more like ... okay . kind of melancholy . sad . not the right feelings for the ending for a romance novella anyway . i ca n't say i did n't like the story . and it was well written . it 's just ... the feelings are wrong .

> if writer/director sofia coppola had in mind to arrest a moment in the lives of two disparate people trapped in the ennui of isolation in a city whose language and life style is in every sense foreign , then lost in translation is a success . after all the hype from the golden globes awards , the media , the endless ads , this small film promised to be revelatory . but at least for this viewer it seems a one-note song that wears thin after about 30 minutes . one aspect that may be considered comedic in nature is the seeming put-down of the japanese people encountered by our couple ( scarlett johansson and bill murray . to these eyes and ears this mimicking of english pronunciation and the concept that nearly all japanese people are ignorant of english in the hotels and the media creates an insulting view . as for the performances murray and johansson make the best of what little they have to work with and finally in the last 20 minutes we begin to care about them as people . not a bad movie , just one that has been over-rated . do yourself a favor when viewing this dvd : turn the volume down to escape the deafening music and the bad karaoke !

> except for the few written with craig dirgo , cussler thriller are always a blast . put aside credulity , ignore the unbelievability of the characters and the strained plots and just enjoy.with the addition of dirk cussler , his son , to clive 's writing stable , things have dramatically - and for the better.this dirk pitt novel , which amusingly revolves around dirk pitt , jr. ( and his sister ) , is the best yet . the plot is tight , the loose ends nicely tucked in . the characters while still their infatiguable , indomitable selves , are a bit more solid.the plot is a doozy . the japanese attempt biological attacks on the united states during wwii . the submarines carrying the weaposn are sunk . a nefarious scheme is hatched to recover their lethal payloads some 60 years later for another attack on the u.s. prominent americans are assasinated in japan and korea . two coast guardsmen mysteriously die on a remote aleutian island . and it keeps getting more involved.this book simply zips along . cussler and cussler are a superb writing team and one can only hope for more to come.jerry

> it was really hard for me to get into this book , and i really , really wanted to . judith is a kid who creates this beautiful world out of `` stuff '' , a place she can escape into to get away from her overbearing religious father and the bullies from school . it 's incredibily talented of her , really . you want to root for her . you want to save her from all that is going on as her father preaches about the end of the world to her . but it just falls flat for me , the story does n't hold me like most do , and it seems like a lot of religious psyco-babble which , as the reader , makes me want to run away . much like the little girl . it was hard to remain interested in this story ; maybe if the religious undertones were a lot more subtle or the storyline had more of a clearer plot ... . i would n't recommend this .
= excellent descriptions and imagery , characters fall flat

> james hunter six 's `` minute by minute '' is a delightful retro romp . the title track is an instant classic with its pulsing beat creeping like the hands of a clock and hunter 's vocals dripping with desire , `` ai n't no worry cause time 's my friend , i 'll get you in the end . '' `` let the monkey ride '' is another jewel with its soft soul groove , `` they say you better let her go , she 's no good for you ; but i could n't cut her loose if i wanted to ; if the truth be told , i never tried . '' `` the gypsy '' sounds a lot like the 60s `` fortune teller '' that can be found on the rolling stones'more hot rocks : big hits & fazed cookies . `` heartbreak '' and `` gold mine '' are also gems on a set that is consistently strong . enjoy !

> four children from very different backgrounds and situations each find themselves with an amazing spirit animal and a heavy responsibility . while three are recruited right away , one ( unknowingly ) is taken by someone who works for the dark power seeking to destroy . and the children 's first quest is to recover a talisman from a dangerous protector.wild born is the first in a new fantasy series by various authors . i never miss books written by brandon mull . and my only complaint is that the story seemed so short . it 's an easy , fast read for children . with an added bonus that children can login online and play a parallel game after reading the books . i have n't tried out the game yet , because at the time of reading it had n't come out yet . however , this is a fun and exciting start to an interesting new series.- review previously posted at scifichick .

> i did n't dislike this book , but i definitely think the ghost story aspect of the book is a bit front and centre , when in fact the ghosts are the least important part of these stories.i did particularly enjoy the first story . the rest of them were interesting enough , but the descriptions the author gave and her sense of humour really shined in the first story . i could see the crumbling hotel and feel the frustration of the main character and the other employees as the owner struggled to make the place better than what it was.overall , i thought this was an interesting book with a bit of history and some interesting culture . if you like reading compilations of family stories passed down from generation to generation this would be a good choice.this review is based on a digital complimentary copy from netgalley and the publisher . all opinions are my own .

> one of the most moving stories i 've read in a decade . every moment spent in these pages is time spent in the grasp of this masterful storyteller.i 'm not sure why i avoided this book for so long . the reviews i 'd read made me feel as if it was a sad story and i did n't want sad . while i cried ( probably more than i should have ) i was left with a feeling of hope , and joy , that i had grown to know these characters . i 'm sure someone is clamoring for the movie rights . this is one of those stories that rarely come along . a story that shows us the best and the worst of us but also reminds us that the simplest things are what make life such an interesting road to travel.and tom . where are the men like tom ? ?

> i am not a reviewer from the alleged blog that submitted 250 negative reviews of happy feet two . with that being said , i must say i was n't impressed with this sequel . despite its message ( which has been employed countless times ) , its just not that entertaining . the characters are n't that interesting and the music does n't match the quality of the original . the dance sequences are mundane and the voice characterizations are n't that inspired . i really had a hard time watching to the finish , but i did and just found it ultimately dull . the film 's weak box office will hopefully negate any future sequels .

> when she was young , this was one of my favorite books that i read to my daughter . i never got tired of telling her how great she would be when she got older . she also loved hearing it , the rhythm of the words never failed to keep her attention . i read her the entire collection of dr. seuss books in the local public library , and this was without question one of her three favorites . as i watch her go through life , i ca n't help but believe that some of the optimism for success that she possesses is a residual of hearing the words in this book .

> while this pilot had a few good moments , it just did n't grab my interest . i may not be the right audience as i tend to like a little more action ... faster pace . i also did n't get invested in any of the characters ... care about them and the problems they face . if only one pilot can make it , there are others up for review that i would prefer over this one .

> `` man in the night '' is a multi-faceted dark tale that may well be easier to read than listen to.wheelchair bound august brill is recovering from an auto crash with his daughter miriam and granddaughter katya in vermont . haunted by the crash , he can not sleep and tells himself stories into the night . he 's a retired film critic who should be writing his own novel , but can not find the inspiration . the plight of a wheelchair bound man alone in the dark is heartrending.brill tells the story of owen brick , a soldier-assassin in the second us civil war . in this alternate history , after the 2000 election the state of new york led the secession from the union . brick is detailed to assassinate the man who has invented the war , apparently a recluse who has invented the war by writing it . the reluctant soldier brick is drawn through a world gone mad.brill also tells the stories of his granddaughter , katya , who is recovering from the tragic murder of the man she loves , and miriam , the daughter , who is writing a book about nathaniel hawthorne 's family . brill 's narrative segues into both film critiques and novel synopses.the story tried my patience as a listener . this is not an audiobook you can put on and go about your workday with the usual interruptions . the story shifts so rapidly you are going to get lost and have to repeat more than once . portions of the story -- for example , brill 's recounting of katya 's response to the film `` the bicycle thief '' were somewhat long and tedious . ultimately , `` man in the dark '' was worth the listen , but i had to clear the decks of anything else to do so.rebecca kyle , september 2008

> after many replacement non-stick pans i finally learned how to use a cast iron pan and love them . i have a 12 '' , 10 '' and 8 '' and i use them for everything . they are heavy , that 's the only negative thing . i oiled it before the first use and spray it lightly before every use . never use soap or chemicals on them . they are better than all the fancy non-stick pans i 've purchased in the past . i make eggs , omelets , pancakes , steaks , pork chops , cornbread , you name it , i make it in the cast iron skillets . i 've compared this with a calphalon professional non-stick pan side by side making pan cakes and the iron pan cooks faster at a lower temperature because the pan holds heat so much better . it 's great for frittata because after the stovetop , i just stick it in the pre-heated oven to firm up the top . makes excellent german apple pancakes because you can saut & eacute ; the apples , brown sugar , cinnamon and butter ; then pour the batter on top and stick the whole thing in the oven to puff up . easy clean up , hot water and a plastic scrubber , then i tilt it to air dry , i do not get rust spots because our water is so hot that it dries within a minute.i 'm getting one for my nephew to make his morning eggs .

> the late liz sladen , who died on april 19th , 2011 , did a great job with this show which is purely for families . all ages can enjoy this one and it 's other series too because like `` doctor who ; this is a family show and this one was shown earlier and aimed to be even more family orientated than `` doctor who ' it 's parent series was . on the other end of the spectrum 'torchwood ' another spinoff is extremely adult ! which is interesting to think about . but all three shows are well done and do their various jobs extremely well . the effects are decent here and thanks to bbc wales for keeping british sci fi alive . if not for them these series and even 'being human ' would be long gone . if you are only into very serious sci fi then this may not be for you . if you are n't worried about it then this is just fine and even the sci fi network showed this one . liz is gone and now so is this series but it had great ratings and would have lasted alot longer . earlier this year the nicolas courtney who played the brigader on 'dr who ' also died both of these actors will be missed by many . the dvd has a great picture and the extras are good enough . this was a good amazon.com purchase for me .

> helloi just purchased these headphones , and i 'm thankful that i have amazon prime . if i did n't have amazon prime , i 'd be paying for shipping , and my purchase would be of even less value.these earbuds are relatively comfortable ( just a bit more comfortable than standard iphone earbuds ) . they are snug , they come with three sizes of inner-ear fitting cones , and they are light . they also look pretty nice.as for sound quality , these phones do not operate as advertised . the sound is reduced , flat , and `` tinny '' , and there is no noise reduction to speak of . in fact , the stock earbuds that came with my ipod offer better sound.i learned the hard way that `` noise reduction '' and `` noise cancellation '' are totally different things . these phones claim th reduce noise by using a silicone ear-bud that `` seals '' in your ears , blocking outside noise.that simply is not true . no external noise is blocked , whatsoever.these were a waste of time . maybe i 'll give them to my 5-year-old nephew for his little tape deck .

> `` lucy the dinosaur : nice to meet you '' by joey ahlbum is a very cute book for young children . this book is very bright and colourful , has short , simple passages that first readers can appreciate with ease and teaches a good lesson to children about the value of friendship and sharing.one of the things that made this book stand out for me , is that there are so many different things in each picture . for very young children , being able to learn new words is so important and looking through this book you can help them to identify many different objects and help them understand how to say the terms correctly . the overall story is cute and the dinosaurs make it interesting for the little ones.this is definitely a book that i would recommend to parents , teachers and grandparents for their children 5 and under . it was a nice way to take a break and spend some time with my children.there are also more books in this series , so watch out for the others !

> this is a difficult book to review because i liked the story but i despised the characters . nick and amy are so detestable in both their personalities and their actions , especially how they capitulate at the end . nick acknowledges that he comes off as ridiculous in his eagerness to please . his desperation to make everyone like him is pathetic . amy is calculating , manipulative , and deplorable . and both of them spew nothing but lies , so they make for the most unreliable narrators in the history of modern fiction . i will give flynn credit for keeping me guessing . the plot was well-paced and captivating enough to keep me engrossed in the twisted schemes of amy and the dishonest antics of nick . i suppose flynn would n't have been able to write such a riveting novel without having such a-holes screwing things up so bad . overall it was a fun read with characters i loved to hate .

> this is one of the books that appeared in print shortly after the announcement was made that andrew wiles had found a proof of fermat 's last theorem . in many ways , the public reaction to the announcement was surprising ; there was a great deal of interest in the problem and therefore , publishers rushed to get a popular book out on the subject.this book is one in the category of popular books , there is very little in the way of complicated mathematics and even then it is not really needed to understand the contents . aczel weaves a complicated historical drama and often interjects verbiage more suited to a children 's novel . for example , on page 133 , there is the passage : '' wiles walked around the department for several hours . he did n't know whether he was awake or dreaming . every once in a while , he would return to his desk to see if his fantastic finding was still there - and it was . he went home . `` many if not most of the greatest mathematicians of the ages are mentioned at some point in this book . while none of them are done in depth , there is enough for you to recognize the convoluted paths that solutions to complex problems often take . furthermore mathematics is replete with `` aha ! '' moments where centuries of effort are suddenly distilled into a clear solution . wiles had such a moment when he patched a serious hole in his original proof.if you are interested in a detailed explanation of what fermat 's last theorem is and how it was proven , you need to look elsewhere . however , if a superficial explanation is the point of your interest and can tolerate some occasional poetic license in the area of exaggeration , then this book will work for you .

> i had some doubts when i began to read the poker bride . lately it has seemed to me many popular history books were little more than magazine articles expanded to include a bibliography . the story of polly bemis -- a sex worker who got luckier than most -- seemed an excellent candidate for the `` not long enough for a book '' prize.to my surprise , corbett seems to have a book here . and an interesting book at that . we know precious little about polly bemis today , and corbett shares as much of the story as can be told . he also tells us the folklore and the myth that grew up around this unlikely western wife . best of all ( at least for me ) corbett gives us a lot of the context of the early chinese experience in the us west . it 's fascinating stuff . some of it i knew vaguely from other reading , but i 've never had such a clear image of the chinese migration.i 'd recommend the book for the material alone . corbett , however , is worth mentioning for his writing . i found it exceptionally good history writing . books like this are so often obtuse . the prose here is crisp , economical , and always clear . i enjoyed the book itself and not just the subject matter.recommended for anyone with an interest in the history of the us west , prostitution , or the chinese experience in the us .

> i am always on the lookout for portable snacks . each box contains five one hundred calorie portions . each packet has about 31 little triangular crackers coated with a nacho cheese flavored coating . the bites are crunchy and hard and the flavor is similar to that of other commercial nacho chips . although the packets are small , the bites are surprisingly satisfying.i appreciated the portion controlled packets . it is so easy to overindulge in chips and the amount provided is sufficient to sate a craving for salty and crunchy . the initial crunch was great but the secondary hardness was a bit off putting . the crackers themselves have a corn flavor that the nacho cheese coating complimented . the foil packets would be easy to slip in a briefcase , purse or lunch box and the bites themselves are sturdy enough to resist crushing.i also tried the sour cream and onion version . the crackers are idenitcal to the nacho cheese variety but sprayed with the coating similar to that found on sour cream and onion potato chips . i did not think it blended as well with the corn cracker as the nacho cheese but it was n't bad.if you are counting calories but yearn for a bit of salt and crunch , these would fit the bill .

> what can i say ? i liked this movie . this is the story of robinson crusoe , a shipwrecked scottish noble . ( okay , i admit it , i read the original book , but i 've completely forgotten most of it , it was a little over 15 years ago ) .i found this book to be quite nice , even without the literary comparison . brosnan plays a character well entrenched in the ways of his time . he is in self-imposed exile , traveling from place to place , until misfortune in the form of a shipwreck leaves him abandoned on a deserted island with only a dog for companionship.eventually befriending a native , ( friday ) crusoe learns crucial lessons on what it means to be a human being , and alters his perceptions on slavery and the human condition.overall , despite a few peccadilloes ( brosnan 's scottish accent was sometimes a little 'slurred ' ) i quite enjoyed this movie . i recommend it for anyone who likes pierce and can overlook the fact that it does n't follow the book to the letter .

> this is a story of a four year old boy 's journey into and out of heaven as explained by his evangelical pastor father and himself ( colton ) . i got this as a `` lend me '' book from my sister and it was n't what i expected , but i did enjoy it.the aim of this book is , to some extent , to have the reader open their mind to the idea and hope that 'heaven is for real ' and will most likely have people considering their faith again . i would caution readers though to remember that it is only a book meant to have the reader contemplate something new.i think that any believing christian who has experienced the recent death of a loved one may feel a tremendous sense of comfort and encouragement from this story . it is a message i think which is similar to alex malarkey 's story in the bookthe boy who came back from heaven : a remarkable account of miracles , angels , and life beyond this world . `` heaven is for real '' is written well in what is considered conversational in tone with a message . colton 's message is that `` you need to believe in jesus to get to heaven '' not just that heaven is real . that may not be something every reader has an interest in so you should understand that before purchasing.bottom line - i enjoyed the book . the chapters are short and this book can easily be read in one day.patti

> the other revieewers have already praised the revitalized sound of this 1950 falstaff , which brings the performance into a soft , warm , human dimension . toscanini conducts without a trace of the hardness and hectic tempos associated with his old age . he paces the opera with utmost flexibility , bending every phrase to verdi 's mercurial imagination . we find ourselves in a world as sparkling as that of a midsummer night 's dream.but above eall this opera needs a great vocal actor to protray falstaff himself . from the first words he utters , giuseppe valdengo makes some things abundantly clear : sir john is fat and gross but still proud . he is a mixture of sly and degraded , hot-headed and witty . valdengo makes us believe that the higher morality is to flout convention and sail through the world a free spirit , but always with the melancholy awareness that flights come to earth with crashing shards of self-delusion . jack falstaff is a world unto himself , so both shakespeare and verdi intended , and both see him with worldly compassion . valdengo manages to hold the center of gravity every moment , something that tito gobbi , for all his artistry , had to strain to achieve , and then only partially . togeehter , valdengo and toscanini inspire everyone else . for two hours the magic spell holds , from a slovenly tavern hangover to a fairy night 's enchantment . bravo !

> `` the adventures of sir gawain the true '' written by gerald morrisillustrated by aaron renier ( houghton mifflin/sandpiper , 2011 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -the third volume of author gerald morris 's totally awesome `` knights ' tales '' series , which retells ( and reinvents ) some of the legends of king arthur and his knights of the round table . morris has written many modern versions of the arthurian tales , but these volumes are pitched ( perfectly ) at younger readers , and have a deliciously humorous tone , poking fun at the tales of chivalry and valor . this book has the story of noble sir gawain , who discovers that being an undefeated fighter might not be as important as being a good friend or as being thoughtful and polite . the book is made up of short , mostly self-contained chapters and like the other two volumes , it 's a delight to read out loud : bust out your bad english accents , and have a lot of fun ! ( daddy joe sixpack , readthatagain children 's book reviews )
= brilliant , hilarious retellings of arthurian legends - great for younger readers

> when sabrent offered a complimentary sample of this cord for a review , i was n't quite sure what someone would do with a 32 foot extension hub.one of my first thoughts was to use this to charge several devices further away from the plug or computer . sadly , i did not know enough electronics to figure out in advance why this would not work . even my 2.1 volt usb charging devices do not produce enough power to charge four 1 volt devices , especially with the loss of power created by the long cord.the cord actually worked best for transferring data on items that were self powered , like my cd driver . it had occasional problems when connecting to my iphone , probably because of the same issue , in fact my & # 34 ; charging & # 34 ; light did not go on when i was connecting the phone.i really debated between three and four stars , in my opinion , for my uses it is just ok. but others who really have a use for this length might differ , so i have given it four stars , because it is well made and carried the data without problems .

> this is a strange book , in the sense that you 'd expect the title character , lisbeth salander , to be the central figure , but she is n't . instead , it 's an investigative journalist mikael blomkvist who has bitten off more than he can chew . she is peripheral to the plot , and remains an enigmatic figure throughout , albeit with exceptional skills and unexplained contacts in the world of computer hacking.without giving away the plot , blomkvist becomes embroiled in the vanger family tragedy ( the vangers are an extended clan which should have been culled to keep things manageable ) . the mystery is made unduly complicated for the purposes of the story , despite which blomkvist manages to unravel it . having done so , he then places himself in jeopardy unnecessarily ( the temptation to shout `` he 's behind you ! '' is hard to resist.at over 500 pages , the book does bang on a bit ( but do n't they all nowadays ? ) . having read it , i feel that i need a period to recuperate before trying to tackle the second in the series .

> if you 're always wondering what its really like to be a seal , this is the book . i 've always wondered what the limits of a tactical operative really are ... .and it appears that the truth is way more impressive than fiction.it has robinson 's narrative style . this is a little terse for some , but if you liked hms unseen , you 'll love this . it 's pretty gut wrenching from almost beginning to end , and nearly non-stop action.if the afghani 's are anything like the arabs , then i 'd say he 's pegged them pretty close . the rite of hospitality is pretty sacred ... when you 're their friend , then you 're their friend ... but when you 're their enemy ... .heaven help you . i think he gave a fair representation of the struggle between the forces of the good , the evil and the misled within the same culture.obviously all the liberal media types will not enjoy this book , but then again nobody likes a mirror held to their own misdeeds .

> i have been using salux wash cloths for over 30 years . my brother was in the navy , tried them overseas and got the whole family using them when he returned home . we used to get them at an asian market in denver but i love amazon ! i can get them on here now.these cloths last forever . i use mine , throw them in the washing machine , use liquid bleach on them and they still last for years . they are great for the shower because they drip dry very quickly . they are just the right texture and length for scrubbing my back and have enough texture to exfoliate but still not be too scratchy feeling . i do n't use them on my face , though-just a little rough for that.they also make the greatest stocking stuffers or gifts . i have got all my friends and family hooked on them . and they come in nice colors . i especially like the green and the peach.try them - you wo n't be sorry .

> if you want a garden ... grow from seed , even a garden on a city deck would benefit more from using seed and not be as costly , plus you would have the advantage of choosing your own varieties . you really do not get much of a harvest for the cost of these seed pods.this was interesting to use and all except the cilantro grew . the pods you receive are : 1 globe tomato , 1 cherry tomato , 1 cucumber , 1 bush bean , 2 loose-leaf lettuce , 2 butterhead lettuce,1 romaine lettuce , 1 snap pea , 1 smooth-leaf spinach , 1 sweet pepper , 2 basil , 2 cilantro , 2 dill.i wish there was a time limit that these would be sent out . receiving a salad garden to plant and grow during the hottest part of july is not conducive to success , no matter what you do and by the time the garden grows in many sections of the country the frost date will beat the harvest .

> brilliant - i loved every minute of this book including the perfect finish.no one is likable . except for poor daisy - but she is the beloved family dog . it was so refreshing to read a book where i do n't have to pull for anyone . where i do n't have to care or be sad for someone . it was like going to a party where you do n't know anyone and you can just observe their behavior and be fascinated when they behave poorly and enjoy it as much as when they behave well.the author gets major surprise points for me that the sexual tension and euphoria is between the husbands . their brief torrid affair ( the novel takes place over a 2 week period ) brought on by the need to escape the nazi occupation ( and inherent fear ) was believable and not prurient in the least . all four characters are delightfully self-centered and amazingly self-absorbed.the author did a terrific job bringing 1940 lisbon to life .

> it was so long ! ! ! the story dragged on . there was nothing exciting . the characters had potential and it would be nice to see them again . the author left the door open for another adventure . but this particular story line was just not very fast paced . it made me want to push it along . there were characters that were mentioned and their opinions played a major influence on the main characters , but you never met them . and there was little to no interaction between them and the main characters . because the relationship between the two main characters was so awkward and strained , it would have been nice to see how they interacted with other people that mattered to them , giving you a sense of how they would act once they became more comfortable with each other.it was just a lot of awkward moments and a slow story line . it had a lot of potential that was just not explored .

> total of seventeen tracks from tears for fear 's repertoire,1982-92 . simply great alternative/new wave music that made it 's initial mark in the '80 's . was never that big of a fan , but i always liked hearing their songs on our local collage radio staion , plus catching their videos on the old mtv days . tunes that make me think back to that era are `` mad world '' , `` change '' , `` shout '' ( my personal tff favorite ) , `` everyone wants to rule the world '' and `` sowing the seeds of love '' . never thought that the creative duo of curt smith and rolan orzabal would last as long as they did . a rather nice pick .

> reading this book was entertaining , but the poor daughter ! the scatterbrained and neurotic parenting style quinn cummings accuses herself of goes a long way toward explaining the child 's performance in school.the book makes fun of all types of fringe homeschoolers , which is admittedly funny . however , most homeschool families are normal people . the author admirably restrained herself from mocking minority homeschoolers ( african americans , asian americans ) and families with special needs kids . most homeschoolers will laugh along at those crazy fringers , as well as at crazy child-actor self-promoters from los angeles ( ahem ) .

> yana toboso 's hit comic series `` black butler '' is a curiously interesting mixture of slapstick comedy , bloody action and dark mystery . set in the fictional 19th century england , the comic follows the life of sebastian , the world 's most competent butler . always cool and smiling , sebastian serves a 12-year-old boy ciel phantomhive , the head of a big company living in a manor house.volume 1 starts with sebastian busily preparing for the dinner . it seems there is nothing he can not do . he can cook , he can catch rats ( by hand ) and he can even kill ( not the rats ) if he needs to . the story gets darker as the young master gets involved in a crime . the volume concludes with one line that strongly suggests sebastian 's origin.the driving force of the comic is sebastian and mysteries surrounding him . smart and efficient , sebastian does everything in a pitch-perfect manner . he is quiet and polite , and his words are often accompanied with dark humor . there is not much originality in the supporting characters , though , including chef baldroy , housemaid mey-rin and gardener finnian . they are meant as comic relief , clumsy and incompetent , but mostly stereotyped and not very funny.finally about creator yana toboso 's artwork . except one-shot comic published in 2004 , `` black butler '' is the only second feature-length comic for her ( after a 2006 comic `` rust blaster '' ) , and in `` black butler '' she still seems trying to find her style . she is good at drawing characters especially in action scenes , but the background is often disappointingly sketchy.frankly , i am not a big fan of the `` black butler '' series , though i find the central character very interesting . if you are an avid manga fan and looking for something different , try this one .

> & # 34 ; darkness betrayed & # 34 ; by christine hughes is a sequel that in my opinion even surpasses the great first part in the series.samantha , our unlikely heroine , still comes to terms with betrayal , hurt and anger , but continues to train hard in order to become stronger for a battle with sebastian and his followers - a battle that is sure to come.an unlikely ally comes in form of damian , the devil.i am not a very religious person and the existence of guardian angels and demons in books often makes me uncomfortable . hughes however has created an excellent character in damien , an ambiguous figure , a fallen angel whose existence and character are multi-dimensional and who teaches samantha and us a lot about the principles of good and bad , darkness and light.in a manner of an interpretation or reading of some bible stories , like adam and eve , the book creates an excellent scene for the battling forces . the principles that damien explains are fascinating and add a lot of depth to the story.the chemsitry between samantha and damien is excellent , both are great characters that drive the plot nicely and perfectly paced.the book is also , and not just secondary to the above , a great paranormal adventure story.an excellent and recommended read .

> i 'm astounded at how many amateur reviewers manage to hit the problem ( s ) square on the head , yet george rr lucas seems to think everyone else has it wrong.dance is a smidgen better than feast . if not for theon , dance would n't have even garnered that much faint praise.the bottom line : i used to recommend this series . i rushed out and bought feast in hardback the first day it came out . i waited several weeks to purchase dance , and even then only the kindle version . if the next book averages 4 stars here on amazon i may be tempted to give it one last chance -- but i 'm through being an agent of the word of mouth campaign ; a song of ice and fire has become embarrassing.i ceased reading and recommending robert jordan at book 4.and one last thing , i 'm an adult who thinks `` adult language , '' when overused , is childish . in the first three books martin 's abrasive language lent the series gritty depth , but in feast and dance it feels more like a desperate ploy to maintain reader interest.shocking exposition wo n't defibrillate a stale story .

> dark and increasingly disturbing this book took me to a place i did n't see coming and that is rare . i figured certain parts out long before they were revealed but the extent to which this book is twisted is a path i did n't even consider going down . is it a love story ? a story of obsession ? a story of betrayal ? or maybe its all of that rolled into one . the beginning of the book is a little slow and it took me a while to get into the groove but then it picks up and swings you around and takes you on a wild ride that you did n't see coming . this is psychological thriller at its best . its not graphically gory its just down right disturbing . did i love it or did i hate it ? i still do n't know i just know i will probably recommend it to others because i need someone else to talk to about it !

> special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film . and what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories , at least for 2000 when this film and dvd came out . at the time , they were the best special-effects i had ever seen , but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see . still , this dvd holds up.audio-wise , the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie i 've heard.as for the story , it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare . it 's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects . the characters are n't particularly involving , either the `` good '' or the `` bad . '' the two leads , played by hugh jackman and anna paquin , should have had us more interested in them , but did n't . jackman 's `` logan/ wolverine '' always seemed to be pouting and angry . ( he got more personality as this series continued . ) for me and most males , rebecca romjin-stamos was a treat for the eyes . her outfit was something to behold.if profanity bothers you , the film was very good in that department , too , as there was very little . obviously , this film was popular enough to spawn multiple sequels . now that all three `` x '' films are out in a packaged blu-ray box set which , i 've heard , looks and sounds fantastic , that 's my next step .

> this review is actually about an accident which damaged my 4th kindle . what do i do with all those kindles ? well , that 's another story.anyway , i was charging my kindle . it was on my desk and the cord was plugged in . i made a quick movement away from my desk and something got hooked in the cord and drug it and the kindle off the desk . i checked the reader and it started up and worked just fine , but a couple days later i decided i had better finish the charging process . that was when i found that the small connector that the charging cord plugs into was somewhere inside the case and not reachable by the charging cord . alas , i now realized that i had busted my kindle.so i had customer service call me so i could report this tale of woe . the man listened as i clearly explained that the damage was my fault , and all i wanted was to get my kindle fixed . he apparently rummaged around in my account information for a few seconds before telling me that i would have a brand new replacement kindle delivered in two days . no charge ! ! ! after going through a bit of administrative stuff like checking my address , etc. , he asked if there was anything else he could help me with . `` no sir , you have absolutely exceeded all my expectations .

> chances are slim that you need a review to tell you what to think about `` friday the 13th . '' for some of us it is a classic . for horror fans whether your first viewing was during the original theatrical run , on a rented vhs tape at a sleepover , or maybe even over that newfangled internet all the kids are using these days , it 's probable it is an important moment in your personal fan evolution . not the first slasher film , but one of the first truly iconic ones ( and let 's not even get started on the sequals ) , we 're all happy to talk your ear off about how important or enjoyable the film is.and for everybody else . . . well , the verdict is that this movie may be fun , but trash.to each their own , i 'm sure.so as for this product itself , it is a dvd that contains a copy of a movie that presumably you enjoy or predict you will enjoy ( or maybe you just enjoy reading reviews of movies you do n't like ) . it is pretty bare-bones . . . no fancy extras or cleaned-up viewing experience . that is fine with me -- when i want to watch `` friday the 13th , '' i just want to watch the `` friday the 13th '' i 've always watched . if you 're looking for something more , keep searching .

> a young boy is taken from his drunken parents and sent to live with family . he ends up on a farm with family he 's never met . his cousin harris takes it on himself to teach the new kid about his special brand of country life . harris is a kid full of energy , humor , and cuss words . being smacked several times a day by his sister does n't seem to help the latter . the two boys wrestle pigs and attempt to jump onto a horse from a barn loft like roy rogers did in the movies . somehow , even after getting his business kicked by a cow , the boy and harris bond over the summer.the story moves at a fairly quick pace , taking the reader from barn loft to horse back to a field with a lynx for a mouse-hunting partner . the reader 's interest is kept just wondering what harris will get them into next and a smattering of kindness and true family heart will help him remember harris and me.be warned that there are several `` hells '' and `` damns '' in the book , and talk of some dirty pictures , though nothing graphic . fast-paced and laugh-out-loud funny , this is one that the middle-schooler is sure to enjoy.armchair interviews says : sounds like a fun read .

> i ended up enjoying this movie a lot more than i expected . the animation meets very high standards , but there 's a lot of good animation around these days . instead , it features characters that i really like and a surprisingly complex plot.i liked the premise , too , that the brave little mouse lives in mouseworld society where bravery is actively discouraged . he even talks to humans - an unconscionable act of bravery . he goes through life blithely unaware that there 's anything wrong , until his antics earn exile from his timid world . that 's about when things start getting complicated . a third society , the rats , adds itself to the mouse and human worlds , with plots moving along in each and between them . another movie might have collapsed under the weight , but this one managed to tie all the threads together and finish them off neatly.a number of dramatic moments might be a bit much for skittish kids . perhaps the book would help prepare your little one , but you 'll know best . the right kid will enjoy it a lot , but there 's plenty here for the grown-up buying the tickets , too. -- wiredweird

> my intention was to get a bassinet we could maybe keep in the car or something , at least bring with us when visiting relatives . yet this could easily wind up being the preferred bassinet . it 's cute , bright , lightweight , sturdy -- all good things whether for the main bassinet or a mere portable one . yes , this could be the main bassinet for anyone.set-up is embarrassing simple ( i asked my husband to get it out and set it up , figuring it would be hard ... ) the rocking feature snaps in easily to the steady base legs . the rest of it just unfolds to provide a roomy space for baby.the rocking was a feature that made me nervous , yet there is no scary-freaky rocking here . a push truly is needed , and i find that safe . i know some people do n't like toys in the bassinet ( myself one of them ) , but these are ones that do not cause a problem.as for the look , this bassinet is just cute . bright , soft colors , simplicity all around.wonderful bassinet . no sense in just keeping it in the car in our situation .

> i 've endured the solar sipper ( mrs. spudman 's brainstorm ) for three , four , or maybe five years now . its promise of water staying water is fulfilled as long as there 's plenty of sun and the temp does n't fall more than a couple degrees below freezing . this winter i tired of trying to remember to bring the sipper in each night to avoid bringing in a solid block of ice to defrost in the morning . the birds flock to the sipper all winter to drink , so i feel obligated to make sure there 's water in there and not ice . on really cold days , that 's a tall order.recently i replaced the sipper with a heated dog dish purchased on amazon for slightly under 20 dollars . the 25 watt dish uses electricity sparingly and keeps the water liquid all night even in temperatures falling into the teens . if you have an outdoor outlet , the electric bowl might be a viable option .

> i remember when `` dragonslayer '' came out in 1981 it got generally good reviews including two thumbs up from siskel and ebert . alas , it was the summer of `` raiders of the lost ark '' and there was only so much room in the marketplace for fantasy films . seeing it again it holds up remarkably well . the film is distinguished by great special effects that compare well with today 's cgi . as they should , good special effects should service a story and not overwhelm it . fortunately , there is an excellent script here by director matthew robbins and hal barwood . the effects also do n't overwhelm the principle actors ( peter macnicol , caitlin clarke , ralph richardson ) who all deliver fine work . the film also has imaginative art direction , great cinematography , and a memorable score from alex north .

> reviewing barilla pasta has made me realize that we eat a lot of pasta at this house . pasta is an easy product to use when you want to prepare a quick dinner since it works well with stir frys , salads , and italian dishes.i first started using the barilla whole grain/multi grain pastas when they first popped up on the grocery store 's shelf . it seemed as though they have more nutritional value than the products made with white flour . since i do n't make my pasta fresh this spaghetti is a win/win because it is super convenient and is healthier.the whole grain variety takes a little longer took cook because even the thin spaghetti has a tendency to be a bit denser . i fill a deep pot with water , put a half teaspoon of olive oil in the water ( it keeps the pasta from sticking ) , and put the pasta in the water once it reaches a full boil . i reduce the heat to a gentle boil and let the pasta cook for 7 minutes . the pasta will be firm yet fully cooked.this spaghetti has a slightly nutty taste but it really is n't noticeable when it is swimming in sauce . the color is a little darker than regular pasta . overall , this spaghetti is tasty and very filling and tastes good . this works well with italian food , but i have used it in vegetable stir frys and broken up in soup.this is an easy way to add something a little healthier to your diet without making any painful substitutions .
= whole grain is a good alternative

> i am a big fan of the pendergast novels . special agent pendergast is one of the more interesting characters to populate the suspense world , sort of an elegant , otherworldly mcgyver.this books opens with the brutal murder of reporter william smithback and the attack of his wife nora by a neighbor . there are eyewitnesses galore who identify the neighbor as the perpetrator . only problem is the neighbor supposedly died two weeks earlier . as the body count rises and the city is on edge , vincent d'agosta of the nypd is joined by pendergast on an investigation that involves rabid animal activists , a corrupt computer programmer , a secretive cult , a retired hollywood director along with the usual mob scenes , monsters , police incompetence and politics.the major flaw in the novel is that it focuses on vincent d'agosta . he bumbles his way through the novel being frustrated and angry and oftentimes whiny . he is okay as a sidekick but is not strong enough to carry a novel by himself . also nora is reduced to the role of hysterical victim . the ultimate resolution is a bit convoluted but on he other hand it is fiction.i agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers who complain that this novel is not up to the authors usual standards . however , it still is entrtaining and worth a read .

> carl nielsen rode a crest of popularity in the sixties when he jumped from total obscurity thanks to leonard bernstein , who made illustrious recordings of the third and fifth symphonies ( they 're still unsurpassed ) . his fourth , which i expected to be another great performance , was badly recorded , however , and lacked the magic of the earlier two lps.following bernstein 's lead , morton gould and jean martinon certainly are trying hard here . i do n't know what they were putting in the drinking water in chicago forty years ago , but both of these recordings are impatient and rushed . the chicago sym . plays stupendously ( they 'd have to , just to keep up ) , and in the fourth rca gives us top-quality sound . the timpani `` duel '' in the finale of the fourth is astonishingly vivid and accurate , ending in a breathtaking glissando that remains in tune . but instead of really digging in , every allegro movement under martinon and gould is a scramble to the finish line , and the phrasing is brash and blatant.as a lover of these works , i 'm glad the reviewers here are enthusiastic , but maybe they 're putting something in the water at amazon , too . to be fair , many critics love both recordings .

> the bluebird effect is a charming book , about one woman 's kindly and unique relationship with birds . each story has loving illustrations of avian , and cute little comments , done in a scrapbook-style . the author really breathes life into the tiny creatures , and talks about them in such a way that they truly touch the heart.i particularly liked the story about the bird with the twisted head , the author found and nursed back to health , but there are so many good ones it really is impossible to choose just a single story . i got the impression that the author and her husband truly cared about the animals they wrote about and spent so much time with.the artist in particular really needs to be commended for the loving , cute and cheerful pictures of birds . i like the way that they are illustrated in a sketch-like manner inside the margins and including cute little notes . this is a great book for bird lovers or to send a friend . i know i will cherish this book on my keeper shelf .

> it 's a physical gift card . pretty much what you expect.i noticed the various card option may have some different restrictions to them as far as denomination , but overall you can get any standard amount you would want.this card came in a bubble envelope for shipping , then inside was my packing slip and a white envelope with text and barcode identifier ( for inventory purposes ) . then inside that card is the actual card with envelop for giving . i 'm not sure if it would vary much if i marked it as a gift and sent directly to the person.the card is decent . not high quality , not low quality.there is plenty of room for writing your own message inside , either below the card or on the inner cover.there are instructions printed on the back of the card for redeeming the gift card online.there is also amazon branding underneath the card.personally , i sort of wish that was n't there so the card would be sleek and clean . but that is just my preference .

> i 'm afraid that the new robin hood with kevin costner , although somewhat of a pleasant distraction , pales in comparison to the original with errol flynn . flynn was well known for his flamboyance and cocky attitude . it did not endear him to all but most loved his style especially in movies like `` the adventures of robin hood '' , `` captain blood '' , `` the seahawk '' , and a few others . in later years his acting in `` objective burma '' showed that he was quite adept at more serious roles as well . in this movie even the supporting cast brings a wide array of feelings of sorrow and amusement to this wonderful film . for a two disk set of dvds with many extras and being a special edition i ca n't wait to get my copy . for the period it was made the color , music , and sets were incredible . it remains a timeless classic that may be copied , but never beaten .

> this item works great . i travel to california now and then and it is always an issue how to position my gps since you ca n't attach it to the windshield . this solves the problem . it is very stable ( more than i thought it would be ) and the holder slips out to make packing a breeze . lots of swivel gives you just about any viewing option you need . and then you can lock that position in place . the price is great here on amazon . you ca n't go wrong . i use it more than i had thought ( not just in california ) . when i park the car i just move the whole thing to the floor which hides the fact i have a gps in the car . i never took the windshield mount down in the past , which was a dead giveaway . great product . price is right !

> this movie begins by depicting the family lives of mel gibson and the men he would lead into battle . gibson 's character is depicted as a compassionate family man and an officer who vows to physically lead his men into battle . when he arrives in viet nam , he and his inexperienced troops are sent on a mission which is almost doomed to failure because of the inequality of their numbers compared to the vietnamese . as the battle rages and men fall , scenes are shown of their wives receiving the telegrams which inform them of their husbands ' deaths . the viewer learns to care about these men and then sees many of them killed in combat . this is a sad tribute to the heroes who died in that battle and those who survived to tell us the story .

> i changed from medium toothbrushes years ago after reading that they caused abrasions that could compromise gum and enamel health . still i missed the firmness and hence was delighted to try this offering from colgate . the brush has a pleasing appearance and is comfortable to hold . there is a polishing star surrounded by the bristles . i found it easy to use and my teeth felt nice and clean . i have not yet noticed any improvement in whiteness and the bristles were not harsh . i experienced no irritation or bleeding . in the final analysis , this is a toothbrush that will most certainly do the job . i did not find the bristles significantly firmer the soft version of this toothbrush . still it provided a gentle clean and was comfortable to use . recommended .

> evil at heart is one of the quickest reads you 're likely to encounter this year . cain has penned a rapid-paced page turner that does n't waste a single word , and will leave you wishing that the next book in the series was due out tomorrow . taking a page from the james patterson school of writing , cain has scribed short chapters that feature different characters , so it feels as though you 're reading a movie . that 's not a bad thing in this case , as the book will have you laughing one moment , grossed out in the next , and surprised a moment later.i loved this book , but new readers should go back and read the first two entries in the series before picking this one up .

> ender 's game is one of the best sf books i 've ever read . ( and mind you , i 'm a girl and not particularly interested in warfare and video simulations ) .it 's a book about leadership , strategy and bullying as much as warfare.not only is the plot enthralling , with a couple of incredible twists , ender 's psychology and development is absolutely brilliant as he is confronted to more challenges by his teachers and classmates alike at battle school - a stifling place indeed.what i really liked too : some chapters open with dialogues between the teachers/soldiers judging ender 's progress and difficulties ; it gives a splendid depth into their perspective .

> one comes to expect quality in an anthony hopkins movie.he has become one of the truly great actors of our timeby making his roles interesting , original , and many times important.in this one he plays an elderly genius with a younger cheating wife.he stacks the evidence so that he gets off and disgraces the young lawyer who is prosecuting him . the twist at the end changes everything.i liked it : the movie makes you wonder where the gunis and the solution is just another mind game played out : a very strange movie from the start .

> the bottom line : marred only ( and slightly at that ) by its unwillingness to develop most of its supporting characters ( warren oates and ben johnson , in particular , come across as empty shirts ) , the wild bunch is a pulsating , red-blooded revisionist western with exquisite direction by peckinpah and some of the best-choreographed violence ever seen on screen : if you have n't yet seen it , make time for the wild bunch .

> joey lauren adams who acted on the `` judging amy '' tv series directs her first feature with `` come early morning . '' ashley judd who i enjoyed in the cole porter bio picde-lovely & `` divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood '' does a good job as lucy fowler who has a lot of alcohol-soaked one night stands but shies from commitment . her performance is rich and varied . i also liked the male lead jeffrey donovan who won best supporting actor for `` sam & joe '' in 2003 from the meth fest that celebrates the actors ' `` method '' for realistic acting . he 's worked in tv series like `` burn notice '' with sharon gless , `` crossing jordan '' & `` the pretender . '' as cal percell , he 's a sincere guy who tries to establish a loving relationship with lucy . some of their love scenes are very tender . lucy 's roommate kim is played by laura prepon from `` that 70s show '' & `` october road '' tv series . her values are quite different as she 's looking for substance over flash . scott wilson does a nice job as lucy 's taciturn dad lowell that she accompanies to a holy roller church . diane ladd with 3 oscar nominations including `` alice does n't live here anymore '' plays her grandmother nana who is in an abusive relationship . the film was presented at the sundance film festival . i think audiences want lovers to get together in the end . not having that happen makes the film seem like it 's about lost opportunities and poor timing . while it gives the film depth , it 's not quite the happy ending we hope for in a romantic picture . the performances here are deep and worth viewing . adams does a nice job of keeping the pacing brisk and making each supporting character seem to be multi-dimensional . enjoy !

> ` dinner for schmucks ' is an easy going comedy starring steve carrell and paul rudd.when tim ( rudd ) goes after a promotion he soon learns that his boss hosts an annual dinner party where each of his staff has to bring an ` idiot ' guest along with him . the most entertaining guest wins a trophy and the member of staff who brought him wins the promotion . although tim is initially appalled by the idea , this soon changes when he meets barry ( carrell ) who is an endearing , but bumbling man who makes assorted dioramas out of stuffed , dead mice . barry brings chaos , but his own brand of charm , into tim 's life and before long the film is in full swing.carrell is very good as barry , who you ca n't help but like despite his annoying tendencies . he tries so hard to please and although everything falls down around his ears , he acts with the best intentions . i found this a lot funnier than i expected and whilst it does n't have much sophistication , it more than makes up for this in visual gags and slapstick humour.some reviewers have given this a rough ride when comparing it to the original , but having not seen the french version i am in no position to judge . i can say however , that taken on it 's own merits it is an entertaining enough film and raises enough laughs to warrant being called a comedy . everyone plays their roles well enough and this is worth watching for the hilarious , quirky and strangely charming mouse dioramas alone . this is good , but not great , but makes for an evenings entertaining viewing.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> in the span of 450 pages of kathryn stockett 's incredible the help , i alternated between giggling , snorting , wanting to a punch a wall , choking back tears and -- finally -- letting those tears fall . the novel broke my heart and then healed it , and i feel like a different person -- a different reader -- after finishing.with fully-drawn characters and the uniquely southern setting , i could n't read this novel fast enough . stockett does a masterful job of building suspense and anxiety while simultaneously keeping us engrossed in the plot . the bravery exhibited by nearly everyone in the story was inspiring and , like the grinch , i felt my heart swelling way beyond its normal size.for me , the help absolutely lived up to the hype -- and i felt so much while reading , which is the hallmark of an amazing book . i really did n't want it to end and wished i could live forever with minny , aibileen and skeeter , the latter of whom i identified with so much . but i wanted more for them . and , more than anything , i wanted them to have happy lives.an important novel that tackles major issues in a dark period of american history yet still manages to be entertaining , lively , affecting and unbelievably moving ? the help is truly a rare find , and it earns my absolute highest recommendation .

> the shirelles assured their place in history with their original version of the goffin-king song , will you still love me tomorrow , a classic song that has been covered many times in several different styles of music . from an examination of their other music , it is clear that the shirelles were hugely influential and deserve to be remembered for more than one song.apart from will you love me tomorrow , their best known song is dedicated to the one i love . originally written by a member of the five royales and first recorded by that group , it was only a minor hit for them . the shirelles popularised the song , taking it high up the american pop charts , though it failed to chart in britain . the mamas and papas covered the song in the late sixties , when it became a huge uk hit . so brits finally realized what a great song this is.two other shirelles songs ( boys , baby it 's you ) appeared on the debut album by the beatles . other great songs include tonight 's the night , mama said , soldier boy and foolish little girl.of all the girl groups of the early sixties , the shirelles were among the best and most important . this compilation shows just how brilliant they were , including all the essentials and many other wonderful songs .

> i 've had the eink kindle before the fire and i have a compatible cell phone . so i have several compatible chargers lying around and did not order this when i ordered my original kindle fire or my kindle hds . of course my original kindle fire had the notorious charging issue , the issue where the port and plug do n't quite fit . and the kindle can sit for hours ( or days ) and not seem to derive any battery at all . kindle customer service replaced my original kindle but did emphasize that i should be using this specific charger to avoid future frustration . that seemed mighty convenient , but i purchased one anyway.so far so good . the plug is still loose , but the fire charges within hours . my hd has yet to have any issues but this charger still charges it faster . more than any other accessory i 've tried ( cover , stylus , etc ... ) i would suggest this as is most necessary . i purchased a kindle fire for both my mother and daughter and will be getting them each one as well . life is too short to have a kindle with a dead battery .

> very interesting premise - russian transplants passing as americans during the height of the reagan era/cold war . solid acting , proper pacing with differing plots and some twists . just something you never really thought about , but which was proved to be true as recently as a few years ago when a number of these transplants were sent packing . a bit too much 'honey pot ' or 'honey trap ' scenarios , but it seems that the producers are trying to be true to reality rather than to pander with salacious details . best plot conundrums : 1 ) & # 34 ; husband & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; wife & # 34 ; actually try to start being a real couple , not a show couple ; 2 ) kids growing up and starting to get suspicious ; and 3 ) the increasing worry of the spy parents about their children and their children 's future if things come crashing down . oh , and the neighbor who is fbi working in counter-terrorism is a great twist . hard to put a finger on exactly why , but it 's quite entertaining for the right mindset .

> since it was made in 1959 , walter 's bruckner ninth has been acclaimed for its melodic grace , absence of grandiosity , and warm personal expression . it 's one of a kind , a treasure from his last period that never hints at end of life , either walter 's or bruckner 's . my hat goes of to mr. vandesande 's review above -- he expresses clearly how this recording differs from the run of german interpretaters who `` take a far differenct view of the 9th , making it more monumental , displaying more fervor and emotion during the peaks of the first movement , and mercilessly driving the music forward in the scherzo . `` at 58 min . walter is on the fast end of a scale that stretches to 68 min . at the other extreme ( giulini on dg ) . mr. vandesande finds the perfect word for this reading : viennese . in its infectious joy walter 's performance removes the clouds from the bruckner ninth and lets the sun shine through , just as johann strauss did for the good burghers of the city .

> firefly is a great show that i knew nothing about before i saw it . i remembered watching this show and saying to myself wow this show is great how come its not a bigger hit . firefly comes from the mind of joss whedon , who is the mastermind behind marvels & # 34 ; the avengers & # 34 ; , dollhouse , and buffy the vampire slayer . the show features nathan fillion , gina torres , alan tudyk , morena baccarin , and adam baldwin . the series is set in the year 2517 , after the arrival of humans in a new star system , and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of serenity , a & # 34 ; firefly-class & # 34 ; spaceship . the ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on serenity . whedon pitched the show as & # 34 ; nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things & # 34 ; .the show explores the lives of a group of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the outskirts of society , as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system . in this future , the only two surviving superpowers , the united states and china , fused to form the central federal government , called the alliance , resulting in the fusion of the two cultures . the show has a great cast and writing is also great , which is to be expected from a joss whedon movie . the visual effect are first class and the show in my opinion is great from beginning to end . once you see this show you will be a big fan and want to watch all of joss 's other projects . i enjoyed this show and i would definitely recommend it.thank you for reading my review .

> this story read like a rough draft . it was as if the author could n't make up his mind what kind of story he wanted to present . the zombies are in it , but they make a very late appearance and are underutilized . the heist element is there , but the characters are woefully underdrawn . the plot is laughable and key elements are unexplained . the entire town is shut down , but it is n't on any news except a late-night am radio show ? and this happened recently enough that the food in the town is still fresh ? you get the impression that both main characters are teenagers , but one of them references a father that died in vietnam . so is this happening now or twenty years ago ? you never find out because i do n't think the author cares enough to figure out a cohesive narrative . other reviews are mentioned the themes in this story , but writing 101 is that you 've got to develop a solid base before you begin to toss in themes.this is a good example of how amazon direct publishing is allowing authors to skip the intermediate steps of their work -- the ones that involve all the hard work between writing down the initial idea -- things like editing , rewriting , and getting opinions from peers and just skip to the fun and sexy part of getting people to read your story . it does n't seem as if any work beyond first draft went into this story . more immediate publishing may seem like a good idea at first , but this author has n't done himself any favors . and he certainly has n't done his readers any favors .

> this was a work purchase because i read and review ebooks . actually a client bought this for me . i was n't prepared to think much of it . just use and have on hand . now i 'm addicted . i read and review ebooks . i read pdfs . i track work emails . i watch videos and manage my prime account , which i love . and i listen to music . recently i bought the amazonbasics keyboard and now compose emails , write stories , do lots more . the only thing i find lacking is bing . but i can search on bing , just more slowly than google . small trade off for all i can do . oh , and i 'm a big apple fan . still i was n't going to buy an ipad and now i would n't no way . i 'm happy with my kindle and would replace it as needed.which reminds me : i did replace it once already because someone near by spilled her drink on it . do n't do that . on the other hand all my stuff was in the cloud and quickly available on my replacement . i like the cloud too.also read through the guides and other books that tell you how to better use your kindle . lots of good ideas . and get the chinese lunar new year of the horse book to demo to your friends how much fun the kindle is ... because showing them a book page does n't do it . but looking up your chinese horoscope teaches them how easy everything is to find .

> we drink a lot of crystal light and have for many years , and i had only ever tried one or two other similar brands . nothing else had measured up . we usually make iced tea , and when that got a little boring , we started mixing half iced tea and half lemonade . the thing was , we never really liked crystal light lemonade enough to drink it straight - it just has a side taste that is too srong.i just received this box from amazon and took a chance and made straight lemonade . we all tried it and were happily amazed . it tastes so much like real lemonade ! it mixes well ( better than crystal light ) and has a delicious tart but sweet lemony taste that is surprisingly refreshing . we make it by the pitcher now and find we need to refill it all the time it goes so fast . it says it has a mix of lemonade and tea , but i do n't detect anything but a lemonade taste . at 5 calories a serving , it 's a great way to pour some jazz into your water bottle.my nutritionist always advises that i drink as much water as possible . when i mentioned this , she said it 's a great alternative . really happy to have something in the refrigerator that is delicious , that everyone loves , and is such a fabulous alternative to sodas and other sugary drinks .
= i 'll never buy crystal light again
< great for the sugary drinks

> overall this is a decent router but after using it for a few days , i went back to my linksys e1200 single band router due to range issues . the linksys provided solid coverage throughout the house . the tp-link had a few dead spots and some weak spots on the upper and lower floors even though it was positioned in the same location ( basically a central point in the house ) as the linksys . adjustments to the router position did n't solve the coverage issues.the installation process was generally straightforward . it 's not as drop-dead simple as the guided install of the linksys , but it did n't present any problems . i was up and running in about 15 minutes.if the range issue was better this would be a five-star product since it packs a lot of functionality at a pretty decent price . however , these features are of no value when you ca n't get a stable connection ( or any connection at all ) , so i 'll have to drop it to 3 stars . it 's certainly worth looking at if you do n't need much wireless range , but i 'd give it a pass if you need multi-floor coverage .
= easy install , nice performance , but some wireless range issues
< decent router but not great

> three problems with the store card:1. it does n't permit passwords to have special characters , only letters and numbers . that makes the password less secure than it should be . considering the amount of identity theft targeted at amazon and its customers , amazon or ge made a very bad decision.2 . the amazon store card is 100 % electronic ; they did n't send me a physical card . that 's ok , but it 's the only place that has a full account number . logging into my account does n't show a full number , only the last few digits . but when i went to log in and was uncertain of my password , the password recovery field insisted on the full number , and said i should get it from my card that they never sent . fortunately , i was able to remember the password.3 . when i log in to make a payment , the first screen it throws is my general amazon account page , not the card payment page . so i always have to log in a second time.there is n't much quality control going on here .
= bad account management , bad web programming
< not as good as the store card:1.

> i absolutely adore this show . particularly monroe , wu and bud.the show is about a detective , nick , who inherits the ability to see mythical creatures that hide in our world today as normal people . he is called a `` grimm '' and the creatures , wessen ( veh-sin ) , are terrified of him because a grimm 's job is to hunt and kill wessen . instead , nick befriends a few and hunts the bad ones all the while trying to keep it secret from the other humans . the people who `` rule '' the wessen world are refered to as royals and are primarily in the old world ( europe ) but are expanding their rule . this causes conflict because of nick 's grimm status.not going to give anything else away but i highly suggest this show to everyone into fairytales , fantasy or anything like that . each episode has some action at least , a lot of humor ( provided by our dear monroe and wu most of the time ) and a puzzle solved and another piece added.great show , great cast and great concept .

> in this fascinating book , author dr. claire berlinski puts margaret thatcher under the microscope . starting with a quick examination of her youthful experiences , she then moves onto an in-depth study of mrs. thatcher as she moved through her political career . the author quotes extensively from people whom she worked with , and against . she explains what margaret thatcher did and why , and examined what it tells about mrs. thatcher the woman.i must say that i found this to be an absolutely fascinating look at mrs. thatcher . i think that the author did a great job of really giving the reader an understanding of what made the iron lady tick & # 8211 ; what she thought of women , socialism , supporters and detractors . in many ways this is a biography of the great woman , but it is so much more than that.so , let me just say that if you want to really understand margaret thatcher , then you really must get this excellent book . i highly recommend it !

> i read over a hundred books a year . all genres . i do n't give a 5 rating lightly . for me a 4 can be something great . a 5 is something that is great and stays with me long after i read it . this will stay with me . i was there with the characters and in that silo from the first few pages . i could feel every emotion , frustration , and even the physical sensation of being dizzy and tired from the trips through the silo . the story kept building and i wanted to know everything and could n't put it down . truly superior writing and storytelling . i can honestly say it was one of the best things i 've ever read and makes what i thought were some pretty good books seem terrible now . . .i 'm talking to you hunger games . i look forward to the day when this has its own movie too because it surely deserves it .

> being interested in mysticism and magic and worlds of wonder , i bought chronicles 1 several years ago . it was n't until this week that i actually picked it up and looked inside . it took only 3 pages to hook me . ms jones is a skilled writer who created her world within just a few lines . although the book is written at a young adult level , the language is not too simplistic and the characters are appealing to readers of any age . ms jones ' metaphors are both practical and poetic . cat and christopher 's experiences as they discover their surprising powers are highly entertaining , and their confusion ( they are only children ) is endearing . i agree that this book is the equal of harry potter and look forward to diving in to chronicles 2 , even though it 's been quite a while since anyone referred to me as `` young adult '' !

> seems to be key in this first book of our new chesapeake shores series by a favorite author , sherryl woods . this book hit the spot . i do n't want to summarize the book , seeing as a lot of people have already done that.however , i have read other books by her and this read did n't disappoint . i could n't decide on one favorite character , by the end they all had me in the palm of their hands.i especially loved at the end , i knew there are a few lines hanging on for other books . although i could guess a few of the endings that might happen , i was really thrilled with the ride . abby , jess , mick , grandma , maggie , trace and all the others would love to have you visit ! problem is we ca n't stay ! -- enjoy the ride !

> i enjoyed 'funny people ' because it was n't the typical silly comedy that has come out in over abundance lately . the film is much more serious than silly with good performances by all and has a sense of reality and truth throughout the story . sandler leaves his goofy bag at home and lets his character become a more likeable and interesting person . the film avoids the many pitfalls of such films and leaves you satisfied and wanting more of these types of films . if you 're looking for an insightful film with some good laughs , you 'll probably like 'funny people ' but it you 're looking for the usual sandler shtick , you might want to pass on this one .

> from the very first page i was enthralled with this story . i had a few friends who had been reading this series and that got me to pick up a copy so i could figure out what the heck they were talking about . i have to say i fell in love with the characters , and it read very smoothly , the story line is captivating , but there is a similarity to the hunger games series that i can not deny.i am now looking forward to the movie and did purchase a softcover book for my keeper shelf . i will probably be investing in the rest of the series as well in the near future . it was that good .

> very campy film with susan hayward , bette davis , and joey heatherton in support . bette once said she only did this for the money to pay for her daughter 's weddeing . the bitchery in their scenes together [ hayward and davis ] must be seen to be believed . vitriol pours from them as apparently they really hated each other . makes a pretty good show with the mother daughter conflict .

> i love my paperwhite : ) it is my favorite out of the five kindles i have owned - keyboard , plain , paperwhite , dx and fire.i love that i can read my paperwhite in any light , bright sun or dark room both are fine . and , even though i read in dim lighting fairly often , the battery lasts a decent amount of time . i also love having my covers back , they are black and white , but being able to see my books this way saves me from having to go back and look up the cover in the kindle store ( as a one-click addict , i have a zillion books . ) and since it has a touch screen , my paperwhite works well for reading on the elliptical or the exercise bike - can set it on the tray and just reach to tap for the next page . the only drawback to the paperwhite is that there is no text to speech ( but i do n't use it often ) .in case you were wondering how the others stack up : my least favorite was the dx , it was heavy and the buttons were stiff . i am still up in the air about the fire because it chews up battery and since it is n't e-ink it offers pretty much the same reading experience as reading on my laptop ( it 's good for other things though , since it 's not a one trick ereader pony . ) the plain kindle has a cuteness factor , and since it 's so small and light and slips into my purse easily , it has an edge over the paperwhite for size . and my first kindle love , the kindle keyboard , has the text to speech going for it.so i love my paperwhite , and am excited to hear about the new features coming with the next generation - hmmm time for kindle number 6 ?

> the third album from keane zaps in from 1989 , or like a branch fromthe killersnew wave cactus . `` perfect symmetry '' comes awash in reverberated synths andduran duranbeats . while it seems an odd tangent from the thoughtfulunder the iron sea , it 's hardly as great a blaspheme as some reviewers here make it out to be . instead , `` ps '' is a well constructed piece of pop , strong enough to rest next to such current stars as coldplay'sviva la vidaorsnow patrol.the opening song is a case in point . `` spiralling '' is a playful , danceable number ala david bowie'slet 's dance . with chipper `` woooo !

> this book was recommended by a coworker to relieve tension . i put it under the christmas tree in 2005 for my wife who was battling a serious illness . i picked it off the stack of books she left behind and saw that she 'd read the first chapter and stopped . i decided to read it . i laughed a few times . i enjoyed the witty banter . the romantic situation with stephanie going off sugar which multiplies her amorous nature , while her boyfriend is laid up with a broken leg is funny . never having read an evanovich , i thought the mystery was interesting . mama macaroni and lula were both distinctive characters . the ending occurred too abruptly . she 's locked up and then she gets freed . it 'd have been more interesting if she were able to use some ingenuity to free herself . this is a breezy reading experience . i can well see how my coworker would have recommended this series . perhaps if i 'd known more about the series , i 'd have started with a different number . this book left me with a desire to explore other authors . but it was okay . enjoy !

> i received this to test whether i could fit my old nikon d70 and my asus w300 tablet ( running windows 8 ) into the same bag . yes , they fit it all right , but the interior compartments are really tight and , to be honest , i find it a little uncomfortable and even a bit frustrating to work with this bag . which is a pity , because the bag itself is solidly made . but when you feel like you want to tear apart a compartment 's walls in order to put in or take out a gadget , you know it 's not something you want to use every day . and all this before i even put in an extra small nikkor zoom lens.in the end , i feel this might do when i simply use it as flight storage . once at the destination , i 'll end up strapping the nikon to my neck and asking my spouse to carry the asus ( actually we always bring our surface , with its bigger 16:9 screen and built-in kickstand ) .

> based on the dc comic ; this film adaptation of judge dredd does n't fully display the heart of the comic it is adapted from , but on it 's own it 's mindless fun with none other than sylvester stallone in the title role . stallone is as stoic as ever for the first half of the film , and seems to have a lot of fun in his role , while armand assante chews the scenery as dredd 's nemesis rico , while a pre-unfaithful diane lane puts on a good show as well . it 's completely mindless ; but thanks to some nicely assembled action scenes , impressive special effects , and a great tightly knit cast ( including rob schneider , max von sydow , jurgen prochnow , joan chen , and balthazar getty ) , judge dredd is better than it is reputed to be ; and with the recent wave of comic licensed films to hit theaters , i find it better than the hulk .

> this is a pretty cool seven cd box set that covers hit songs of the 1970s . it features songs from many different styles of music ; including pop , rock , country , folk , r & b , disco , novelty and others . a few of the songs are preceded by brief excerpts from news reports or press conferences . i know that some people did n't like this aspect of the collection , but it did n't bother me , because the sound bites usually relate to the following song in an amusing way . there are many great songs here , and there are also many not-so-great songs ( `` feelings '' , anyone ? ) . a lot of these songs are quite frankly on the `` cheesy '' side , but in a way that is part of their appeal . this collection does a fantastic job of covering the good , the bad and the ugly of 1970s popular music .

> thankfully , this novel validated my feeling that the `` story '' that was told to the people in chicago in insurgent ( book 2 ) did n't make sense . however , actions of the characters and the extent of chemical/scientific abilities seemed so unbelievable -- even laughable at times -- to me , that i could n't enjoy the book overall . some of the characters had a lot of heart . and , the ending was pretty rough on me ( even though i knew that something would happen ) . but , overall , the story arc of the last two novels never seemed as engaging or valid as the first novel , divergent . in fact , this will be one of the trilogies , like matched , where i 'll feel that i have to caveat any recommendations of the first book in the series by warning them that it goes downhill after that .

> one worthwhile sequence in the entire film , no matter which cut you see . that is the battle in jerusalem . it is harrowing and meaningful , resonating much more effectively than any of the other sequences . the irony of that scene is well conceived and really makes one wonder why did they get only that part of the film so right , while the rest of the film is the same sequence over and over with a different setting . do n't waste your time . zombies have always been boring even if they are fast moving and behave like flocks of birds like they do in this film . if you are new to this genre , simply go back and watch the 1968 version of the night of the living dead and you will have seen the only zombie film worth watching .

> color me impressed ! these can be no thicker than a sheet of paper , yet this product keeps me as dry asalways xtra protection regular daily liners , unwrapped , 100 countand for as many hours per wearing ( about 4-6 depending on the flow ) .when i first opened these i thought to myself that this must have been a mistake - there was no way these would fit on my g-string panties . but they do.i like these much better than the pads that are made specifically for thongs . these are thinner and meld to your body better so you do n't feel the pad in places you should n't like you can with thong liners .
= wow !
< great for the price

> i like the way this shampoo lathers . i used just a small amount and got gobs of lather.i also like the way it smells - kind of a musky floral scent which i like a lot . and i 'm sensitive to odors and this does n't seem to be bothering me.the things i do n't like are that even though it seemed to rinse out easily , it left my hair weighed down . and i do n't see any noticeable difference in shine or conditioning.i have a lot of fine , color treated hair about shoulder length long .

> the bottom line : one of the 10-15 best films of 2009 , michael mann 's public enemies is a fascinating study of the rise of the fbi and the downfall of an age in american criminality ; though a lot of events have been rearranged chronologically to suit the needs of the story , you 'll hardly care while watching depp 's superb dillinger or the typically impressive photography by mann and cinematographer spinotti.3.5/4

> the book of eli is an entertaining action film . it 's about a man who has invincible ( or rather , nearly invincible ) super powers as a result of a book he carries around with him everywhere he goes.he also contains super human strengths apparently , whether because of the book or just because the movie writers needed to make something exciting happen in order to entertain the viewers- i do n't necessarily know which one it is.anyway , he travels across deserted lands telling everyone he meets that he 's travelling west , until he ends up coming across a group of power hungry smalltown thugs who would like nothing more than to take the book away from him once they discover he 's carrying it.the entire storyline consists of the man trying his very best to protect the book and keep it away from those who do n't know how to handle its power.i really like the gloomy setting that takes place throughout the movie . it 's always exceptionally bleak and succeeds in delivering the scenery of a post-apocalyptic world perfectly . the grey clouds , the eerie silence , the emptiness ... just a frighteningly realistic scenario.the acting is pretty good for the most part , however my only complaint is that the storyline was n't strong enough to keep me attached . there 's only so much you can talk about when the storyline pertains to protecting a book with special abilities.however some of the shooting and fighting segments were really good , my favorite being the shoot-out at the one house resulting in a portion of the house literally being blown apart . i loved this part.overall , the book of eli is a pretty good film . it 's easy to follow , and the action segments are pretty strong .
= worth seeing

> each of the 60 chapters could be the basis for an entire book . i found myself reading along , become intrigued by a snippet , be drawn to look for more detailed information , and end up getting a book to satisfy my curiously for indepth details and back story . a wealth of information with corresponding maps , pictures , and statistics . i spent an entire weekend looking through it and i 'm not nearly at the end . the only thing it is lacking is an equally complete index . this is n't a one shot for this author . here are just a few of a lifetime of titles on railroads : & # 62 ; down the tube : the battle for london 's underground ( 2002 ) , & # 62 ; the subterranean railway : how the london underground was built and how it changed the city forever ( 2004 ) , & # 62 ; broken rails aka on the wrong line : how ideology and incompetence wrecked britain 's railways ( 2001/2005 ) & # 62 ; fire and steam : a new history of the railways in britain ( 2007 ) , & # 62 ; blood , iron and gold : how the railway changed the world forever ( 2009 ) , & # 62 ; engines of war : how wars were won & lost on the railways ( 2010 ) , & # 62 ; the great railway revolution : the epic story of the american railroad ( 2012 ) , & # 62 ; to the edge of the world : the story of the trans-siberian express ( 2013 ) ,
= gorgeous introduction to the history of railroading
< a great book !

> this sequel is n't as good asthe prince and me . rather than keeping the winning acting of julia stiles , this movie replaces her with kim heskin , who has neither looks nor acting ability to recommend her . where julia stiles played the character of morgan paige with grace and dignity , heskin seems like a whinny teen . even though malby stayed in the sequel , he seems a much smaller man . inthe prince and memalby 's king edvard acted like a true king and took command , holding a cabinet meeting . inthe prince & me 2 - the royal wedding , malby 's king is indistinguishable from any pathetic teen guy.the only thing that savesthe prince & me 2 - the royal weddingis the plot . it 's entertaining enough to smooth over the deteriorating acting . it focuses on a plot by a corrupt uncle to sabotage paige and edvard 's marriage by raising a legal prohibition against a non-scandanavian queen . princess kirsten , paige 's competition for edvard 's heart , is a breath of fresh air , bringing grace and cunning to the film . not only is she much better looking than paige , but she never overacts - until the grand finale .
= not as good as the first one

> when you compare the kindle fire with similar devices , the price must be a huge consideration -- meaning , do n't complain that it does n't have the same functions as an item that costs twice as much . the kindle fire is an excellent pad computer for the whole family . it 's small , light , and simple enough for my 7-year-old to carry it around and play games on it ( and cheap enough that i do n't freak out if she does n't carry it as if it were a ming vase ) , also small , light , and durable enough for my wife to throw it in her purse and use it for email checking and web browsing , and a great size for reading books on the plane , checking something in the car , etc . yes , it does n't have all the features of an ipad , but it 's less than half the price , weighs much less , and you wo n't feel the need to haul it around in a big , bulky , protective ( and expensive ) case . for the money , it 's a great unit .

> this is n't far behind the great first godfather film , done two years earlier . it 's another magnificently filmed effort , wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once you 've put it in your dvd player . the only thing missing is marlon brando 's character.one thing was just as good if not better than the first film , and that was the cinematography . the browns , blacks , greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes . i especially love the italian houses and scenery . why this was not even nominated for an academy award in cinematography is mind-boggling.the story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother michael ( al pacino ) . it also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.there are some excellent supporting performances in this film , too . i especially would cite the roles played by michael gazzo and lee strassburg .
= do n't overlook the great photography

> i was skeptical about the chromecast device because i was n't sure exactly how it worked . once i received it the light went on . here are the things you should know . you need to have hdmi and usb ( the usb powers the device ) connections on the side of your tv or be able to get to them on the back of your tv and you need to have your own wifi connection , you need to install chromecast on your phone or laptop etc . once installed you can connect using your wifi connection . make sure you have your wifi router password ( it 's just like connecting your smart phone to your network . you can then ( if you have and account ) connect to netflix and youtube . make sure you select the right input on your tv . once done you can take the device and connect it to any tvs in your home that have the same ports and it will work .

> i would rate this a low four , high three for one reason only : it seems at times that this author has romanticized the crimes that the men who were put in alcatraz did and the men themselves.to read this book is to read a handful of letters between family and the warden and the criminals themselves . the author provides copies of the letters as well as typed copies so that you can easily read the letters . the author also includes a brief background about the criminal , the crimes he committed , and if any information is known what happened to the person after he left the prison.the book is not a long read and it is very interesting . if you are interested in true crime and history this might be a book that interests you .

> overall a good album . i remember riding my bike to the record store to get this mostly because a girl i liked had it . anyway , though not as strong as the previous album , `` new jersey '' still has some gems . i always break this album into thirds in my head . the first third is the strongest , with the 3 big rockers plus `` living in sin '' . the second third to me is just blah , not bad , but not good , and the last 4 tracks are a good combo of rockers and ballads too . in short i 'd say a must for the real fan , but otherwise `` slippery when wet '' or the `` cross road '' collection should be enough for casual fans .

> i 've been reading these for a while , like many people on here.i have n't been able to get past the first three episodes of the show yet . i know it 's good but it 's not as appealing as the books for me ! that said , the reason for the three stars is my dissatisfaction with the author , and his inability to focus on this series ( or amazing ability to spread himself on many projects at once if you want to go positive with it ) .

> & # 34 ; warm wishes & # 34 ; by tony gilbert is a short horror story set on christmas eve . the curiosity of two young boys gets the better of them but when they sneak down to see what presents they got they get a terrible surprise.this piece is well plotted and has a great dark and atmospheric feel to it . using quite powerful visual descriptions the horror part is quite impressive and the denouement is quite satisfying.worth a read .

> i love hidden object games , and `` hidden objects : secret gardens '' is one of the better ones that i 've played on my kindle fire . the game includes 24 pretty garden scenes , each having 14-20 hidden objects , each of which is listed at the bottom of the screen . as you progress through the screens , there are more and more `` red herrings '' - objects that appear but are n't on the list . each screen has a countdown timer ( varies from 1:00 to 1:20 as you progress ) , and there are up to six hints available if you need them.game play is extremely simple . when a scene appears , you have a few seconds to get your bearings , then the countdown timer starts . the first few screens are pretty easy , but as the number of objects increases , it gets more difficult . some objects stand out like `` store thumbs , '' but others ( like a three-leaf clover ) are well camouflaged and are harder to spot . it took me about an hour to complete all 24 screens , and i had to replay several screens when the timer ran out.there are no scores as such , although a competitive player or players could record their times if they wanted to replay the game and go for better times . it would be a nice feature if the game offered a two-player mode or at least a scorecard to keep your best times . for that reason , i 'll knock down my rating slightly to 4 stars ( rounded to 5 stars for amazon ) .with the ease of learning and the very simple game play , the game is appropriate for almost any age .
= lovely garden scenes , a nice hidden object game for all ages

> i have n't read many nicholas sparks books . actually , i think i 've only `` read '' two including this one . the other being the lucky one . and both i 've actually listened to the audiobooks , but i do love the movies based on his books . it 's no surprise that this man is a gifted storyteller.that being said , nicholas sparks has developed a reputation for killing off at least one character in every book . and while death is most certainly a part of life and it 's all around us , it lends to his predictability . every nicholas sparks book or movie i begin immediately attempting to discover who 's going to end up dead . he did n't disappoint in killing of a character or in his predictability.i did enjoy the guardian , but i do n't think one thing caught me by surprise . i 'd email my sister , who i borrowed the audiobook from , and say `` x is a creeper is n't he ? '' or `` x is going to die , right ? '' she can attest . i do believe every single guess i had was correct.but the story was well-developed . the characters had a backstory and history . i can see this coming to the big screen and being a hit as mr. sparks other books have been.all in all , i found the guardian to be predictable but a solid read worthy of a middle of the road rating of 3 stars . have you read the guardian ? if so , what did you think ? let me know ! more reviews at somewhere only we know - [ ... ]

> `` the bourne ultimatum '' is a non-stop action thriller that continues the saga of jason bourne ( matt damon ) , a cia-trained assassin in search of the people who brainwashed him and trained him to kill for them . picking up right where `` the bourne supremacy '' left off , the film opens with bourne evading the moscow police . he then heads to london , where he reads a newspaper article in which journalist simon ross ( paddy considine ) describes jason bourne and a cia operation known as blackbriar . bourne arranges to meet ross at waterloo station to get information on his source , but corrupt cia official noah vosen ( david strathairn ) interferes with the meeting . still , bourne is able to get information on the blackbriar source and sets out to get to the bottom of things.this movie is incredible . every scene is one seamless action sequence after another . bourne travels to multiple cities across the globe , and the director uses crazy hand-held camera work to enhance the action scenes . i really like the fact that the bourne films are n't littered with unnecessary special effects . all the surveillance , chase and fight scenes are done exceptionally well so they do n't look fake . the theatre i went to was packed , and it was fun to see so many people on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film , gasping and cheering at the appropriate places . bourne is a modern-day james bond , and i sincerely hope that damon will make a few more of these incredible movies .

> out of all of kristan higgins books that i have read , this was the saddest book , almost to the point of being depressing . almost ! written in the first person , with engaging characters , very believable dialogue and no little amount of humor , this book about a young widow finally wanting to reemerge into the dating scene.lucy lang one of the notorious hungarian black widows , wants someone who is going to be a good guy , someone who is steady , with a good job . someone she wo n't fall passionately in love with since she has already had passion and look where it got her ! a good idea in theory , but not so much when it comes down to practicing it ! lucy has been having a `` friends with benefits '' kind of thing with ethan . ethan is someone she finds that she can fall madly , passionately in love with ... there is only one little problem . ethan is her late husbands brother . someone she was sort of dating when she met her dead husband . someone who has been in love with her since the first time he met her ... or almost ! kristan higgans has the ability to engage a reader right from the very first chapter and keep you reading till way into the night . the giggling and guffawing that goes along with her books is a big plus too ! kristan never fails to take what looks to be a hopeless situation and give us our beloved happily ever after .

> this is a very interesting book about a young policewoman who is dealing with a debilitating , basically mental , illness , while still doing her investigating job . a mother and young daughter are found murdered , the child is a very awful manner , and the police begin to investigate . it appears that prostitutes are involved , but when there is talk with these women , another body is found , obviously a warning from the killers to the prostitutes to keep quiet.the protagonist has her own methods of detection , and they do not always conform to standard police procedure and protocol , which does nothing to endear her to her colleagues . despite this , she continues to attempt to `` do her own thing '' , even knowing that she might be jeopardizing her job . the book gets really weird when the protagonist spends the night in the morgue with the three victims ' bodies.there is a reason behind all of the writing about the woman 's illness , an homage by the author to a woman who had this illness , and took her own life . the plot builds up steam , and the final confrontation between the policewoman and the bad guys involved in the killings is tense and terrifying . there is a happy ending , of sorts , which will inevitably lead to another book in what the author hopes to be a series about this policewoman . i , for one , will be looking forward to reading future works .

> if you can accept the convention that a modern , highly educated , young woman , in her late twenties , consistently acts like a four year old toddler , male or female , when deciding whether to do something that might put her in danger of bodily harm , then you will probably accept this cozy set in the new york state beer-brewing country . our heroine is an on-the-verge-of-bankruptcy small brewer desperately in need of a bank loan when she finds the body of a murdered neighbor which makes her persona non grata with the bank . meanwhile her former lover from law school ( beer was closer to her heart than law ) , who also deserted the law to become a police officer , turns up to be detective in charge of the case . of course , there are also the two brothers , sons of the murdered man , one of whom she has always held dear to her heart , the other of whom , has disappeared , with no word from him for years . naturally , the former lover and the former best male friends play out their roles to provide romance , frustration and romance once more.the book is well written , light , amiable and minimally violent . i should think most cozy readers will find it congenial fare .

> this is the story of a mayan who escapes captivity to return to the pregnant wife and son he has hidden in a well . usually it is the kind of story that i love but this movie seemed more interested in showing needless violence than in telling the story.there was a lot of hype for this movie , especially since this is the follow-up of mel gibson 's incredible movie `` the passion '' . but when the closing credits started rolling the person i was sitting next to asked , `` what was the point of this ? '' i could give no good answer.but in the heart of mel 's other movies ( like braveheart ) , the cinematography is amazing . even the story is fantastic but the end resolution left me a little bit in disbelief . i 'm still looking forward to more movies from mel gibson but in the end i wish i had just stayed home this time around .

> received the book this afternoon and just finished it - whew ! i honestly believe this to be one of those books that tells it like it is ; no hollywood heroics , no fancy tech-speak - you hear the good and the bad as well as the quirky.from the pranks pulled during down-time to the fast paced descriptions of running gunfights with our enemies , you get a small peek into the real world of the navy seal . these guys are no joke ; they can turn up the heat and bring on the hurt - and the next day be back at home tending to their lawns , paying bills and changing diapers.if you have read any of the many books coming out of the experiences in iraq or afghanistan , you need to add this one to your collection as well .
= a three hour roller coaster ride .
< wow !

> i like the movie because the agent triplex is beautiful but the story does not make sense ( i am aware it is a bond film , allow me license for my review please ) , the kgb working in cahoots with her majesty 's service ? that is outright treason , but despite this and a couple of shortcomings such as the evils of capitalism from the kgb agent herself and the `` cooperation '' on both parts , the film is pretty decent and my favorite part the lotus esprit ( although i am partial to s2-80 's lotus esprit turbos ) is really really great but the driving not the underwater scenes , great sound emitting from the car and of course jaws .
= the spy who loved me .
< pretty decent movie

> i have been reading thayer 's books for a long time . `` summer breeze '' was alright but i enjoyedbelongingmuch more andthree women at the water 's edge . `` summer breeze '' lacked the depth and pathos that some of her other books have held . there were lots of characters but i did n't particularly like any of them , especially the females.i did enjoy the lake descriptions and sections about life on dragonfly lake . i would n't mind living there at all . it seemed like thayer 's efforts this time around went into inanimate objects ( i also liked the store renovation ) rather than in character development.too many characters , all too shallow and all entangled !
= ahhh , to be sailing on dragonfly lake !
< alright

> alternately haunting and sweetly affecting , `` sling blade '' is a beautifully accomplished debut by actor-director billy bob thornton , who conceived , wrote , directed and starred in this absorbing drama . ( he won an oscar for his original screenplay . ) thornton 's cathartic , humane portrayal of childers -- a mild-mannered simpleton who quietly protects and cares for frank and his mom but is haunted by the past -- stirs our deepest sympathies . in a nuanced turn , the late john ritter excels as linda 's gay friend vaughan , but the real surprise is country singer dwight yoakam , whose hateful , hard-drinking doyle guides the film 's tragic final act .

> product is everything you want in a pedometer ! i am not so tech savvy ... ..and this product is easy to use , even for a 66 year old ! omron customer service is excellent ! ! ! ! ! ! like i said , i am not too tech savvy . when i started to program the pedometer the first screen was not what it showed on the operation booklet . so i called customer service , and they talked me through setting up everything . so nice , so patient , so competent ! i would purchase another omron in a heart beat just because their customer service is soooooo gooood !
= worth every penny !
< great pedometer ! ! !

> where to begin ? you will laugh out loud through the entire movie . this movie is easily one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . owen wilson and jackie chan make the perfect comedy team . i was literally crying from laughing so much . this movie has great replay value , so it is definately worth owning . the special features are also very cool ( and there is a lot of them ) . highly recommended . if you liked the rush hours ( which were funny ) , then you will absolutely love the shanghai's.also recommended : shanghai knights rush hour rush hour 2
= one word : hilarious
< the best movie ever made !

> we have way too many kindles and cases but when i ordered my daughter the new fire hd i needed a new case.this one is actually prettier than it is in the picture . it is a nicely textured classic look . the fire hd popped right in and is completely secure . it works great for watching movies or youtube . the other belkin cases i have have lasted well . i see no reason for this one to be any different . i can see no flaws or weakness that would be problematic .
= good case
< great case.this

> not a religious book , but a factual account of life in jesus 's time . it 's really violent - i do n't know how people could stand living then - i guess they had no choice ! i wondered what joseph and mary did with the gold the 3 kings brought them ? i guess you can tell i 'm not very religious !

> goldberg variations by susan issacsi really do n't know what i can say about this book that has n't been explained in the synopsis . except that , this book is chock filled with unpleasant characters and i do n't mean just gloria the grandmother . i found the grandchildren childish and whiny . granted , the grand-kids did n't know what the weekend was going to be about and again granted they felt ignored by their grandmother all their lives . i just do n't get them ( the kids ) feeling this much anger at something they never had so they could n't miss it/her.at any rate , this book had each chapter written in a different person 's point of view , which was very disconcerting and at times annoying . the plot was thin , contrived and obvious right from the start. & lt ; -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- spoiler -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- > there is no story except that the grandmother learns to be a better person by the end of the book . and of course you could see that 'plot twist ' coming from a mile away . she manages to become this better person with a little discussion about religion with one of her granddaughters. & lt ; -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- end of spoiler -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - > in a way i felt the book , coming from the 'mother of chick ' lit , as it were , put a little too much emphasis on matt getting the company and did n't quite reflect on how either of the girls could have done with it.i was fairly saddened at this book because it was just a , character study , that did n't entertain me . books should enlighten , entertain , elate or educate - this book did none of those things for me . *arc supplied by publisher*
= 2.5 stars - i had such high hopes
< not as good as the synopsis

> i was n't disappointed , per se , but i was n't enthralled either . there was nothing about this book that grabbed me and would n't let go . often , i was flat out bored , and sometime about the mid-point of the story , collins started writing random fragment sentences . they were so jarring to me.no idea if this is a spoiler or not , but i am proceeding with extreme caution : the hunger games , without the games ? just not the same . i knew there was no possibility of games , but i did n't realize how much it would change the dynamic of the story and virtually remove all the excitement from it.bella , i mean , katniss was n't really herself . and how many near-death-experiences was that ? she spent most of the book in the hospital.speaking of death , collins has n't been shy about killing off characters , but this seemed like overkill ( ha ! ) . and graphic . holy cow ! extremely violent . unnecessarily so.end what probably was n't at all a spoilerso , i do n't know . it sounds like i disliked the book , and i did n't . but it holds none of the allure of the first two , and i personally did n't find it a particularly satisfying ending to what was a great series . i know that the final outcome was , in a sense , pre-determined , but i think there could have been a better way to get there . collins got a little wrapped up in finding creative ways for people to die . for the age group this is intended for , i found it too much , too harsh and frankly , too sad .
= left me glad it 's over
< not the best

> mr. brooks is an interesting suspense about a man who takes pleasure in killing other people . along the way , or rather , after the first killing that we see in the movie , he meets someone who 's apparently a photographer.the guy happened to take a picture of the killer shooting a couple ... um ... `` doing it '' in a bedroom . he even positioned the bodies in a sick sexual way after killing them so the cops would see the bodies in that position when they arrived to the scene.the story gets interesting when the killer meets the guy who snapped the picture of him in the middle of the killing , because it turns out the photographer does n't have any plans to turn the killer in after showing him pictures of the killing he just committed . instead , the photographer actually wants to go with the killer on his next `` kill job '' .so the killer and the photographer go around town searching for the next victim . this takes up a good portion of the movie , building suspense the entire time.this movie is great because it builds suspense and shows you what 's it like to get inside the head of someone who has no compassion for human life . the entire film focuses on the killer having a make-believe friend helping to convince him go through with the killings . the invisible friend is just the voice in his head.also , the killers daughter plays a big part in the film with some neat twists you wo n't see coming.anyway , when the story gets going , the movie turns into a really solid film overall . i recommend this film to just about anyone interested in violent movies .
= great film
< a great film

> when the boys in the jackson five grew to be men , new edition took the throne as the reigning r & amp ; b boyband . in the 1980s , they stole the hearts of teenagers and had a string of decent hits both on the pop and r & amp ; b radio . & quot ; hits & quot ; is n't the first collection of its kind , and the tracklisting is n't flawless , but it 's a pretty good survey of this roxbury-based group from 1984 to 1996. from the bubblegum fare of the irresistible & quot ; cool it now & quot ; and & quot ; mr. telephone man & quot ; to the more adult-sounding & quot ; if it is n't love & quot ; and & quot ; hit me off , & quot ; new edition 's greatest hits set shows how these guys evolved from boys to men . i 'm slightly disappointed that & quot ; hits & quot ; does n't have & quot ; popcorn love & quot ; and & quot ; candy girl & quot ; from their debut album , but those tracks were released from the streetwise label . so , understandably , they would n't be here . it 's a minor flaw , but i can live with it . everybody has heard at least one song by new edition , and & quot ; hits & quot ; is the album to get for a one-stop survey of their singles . if nothing else , this cd gives us a much-needed reminder that bobby brown did indeed have a career long before he married you-know-who .
= new edition - 1984-96 .
< a pretty good survey of their singles

> after a series of catastrophes and wars , north america has collapsed and has been rebuild into the state of panem . panem is divided into multiple districts plus the capital . each district produces something of value for the capital . for example , district 12 , katniss ' home , produces coal other districts produce . based upon a revolution that occurred 74 years ago , each district much select one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the hunger games . the hunger games , put on for the amusement of the capital , is a fight to the death . when prim , katniss 's little sister is picked to participate , katniss immediately jumps in and takes her place . peeta , the mail tribute and katniss , along with their drunken mentor haymitch , but come up with a plan to survive.i was intrigued with this book from the beginning . it reminded me of the short story `` the lottery '' which i read in school . i found the political and economic situation to be fascinating and thought provoking . although it is thought provoking it does so without screaming the message in your face . overall , it is a fast-paced action story where teenagers must battle the elements and each other to stay alive . i do think that for boys , the focus on clothes and styling may take away from the action adventure , but overall i think any teenager , young adult , or even regular adults would love this book .
= hunger games
< a fast-paced action story

> `` breaking bad '' is undoubtedly the best television show ever made . i am 52 years old and have been watching tv for a very long time . this is the only series i have bothered to buy the dvd 's and watch it all over again . the cinematography , music choices , writing , acting , plots , comic relief ... i do n't have enough accolades for this series . what is great about bb is that every year it kept getting better and better . incredible consistency throughout all the seasons . i ca n't imagine any other actors playing the roles . the villains were absolutely top notch and high octane . they gave it their all . so much so that raymond cruz ( tuco ) requested to be killed in the series . the character was so intense and draining . this series would have never seen the light of day in network channels . i love that cable tv has taken a risk with edgier and mature subject matter without being vulgar nor obscene . you can tell that amc trusted vince gilligan knowing that he would take the series as far as he could without crossing the line . i am very satisfied with the ending . it ended how it had to end . i am very sad it 's done but boy , did we have a good ride ! kudos to everyone involved and thank you .
= outstanding !
< best television show ever made

> some heart fans like to pretend that 1985 's self-titled heart album never happened , but the band 's makeover as a keyboard-heavy aor act gave their career a much needed shot in the arm , as well as some much deserved attention . between the hitmakers brought in to contribute on songwriting to the shiny 80 's production job , the band 's self-titled album was as good an aor album as you could hope for , and featured some of the band 's biggest hits.sure , the band `` sold out '' and the material on heart is much more radio friendly than their early material , but we 're not exactly talking starship 's `` we built this city '' here . the tracks on heart are well-crafted pop songs that are written to take full advantage of the wilson sisters ' considerable talents . i was blown away by the glorious , dramatic `` what about love '' and `` these dreams , '' and the infectious `` never '' and `` nothin ' at all '' two decades ago ( god , has it really been that long ? ) and am just as impressed today.i can see how old-school heart fans could have a problem with this album , but this is the heart i grew up with , so i 'll always consider it a classic album .
= extreme makeover
< a classic album

> in terms of functionality , this is a wonderful reading 2-led light.like the others , i also own the fulcrum led reading light . and so , i will consider that along with my pros and cons : pros : + this reading light is much lighter using button batteries instead of 3 & # 34 ; aaas'.+ it has a push-button on/off switch which is more convenient rather than a slider switch . the slider switch on the fulcrum sometimes suffers from contact quality problem - it flickers.+ the clip grip is strong enough to prevent the light from falling or shifting its position . it also has a wider clip.+ strong metal neck that does not droop and stays in place.cons : - less light than the fulcrum.- button batteries ( it uses cr2032 ) are more expensive and not easily available in every store . it is also not rechargeable.- to replace the batteries , you will need a tool . you can not just snap the cover to open it . it requires a small watch type screwdriver.- cheap looks and construction.made in china.update : my first unit has a defective switch . the thing does not want to turn off.got a replacement from the vendor which works perfectly .
= great reading light . convenient , with an easy on/off button switch
< wonderful reading light

> these iphone screen protectors are wonderful and frankly , so refreshing to see . they are the `` old fashioned '' screen protectors you 'll see that do n't cost $ 20 for a single protector that 's supposedly better made , which come with an extra squeegee to get the air bubbles out and spritzer to clean your screen . no gimmicks with this - it 's the screen protector , cloth , and smoothing card . everything is completely functional.the screen protectors have a great finish to them as well . they are easy to install and really require no instructions . basic , just as it should be . everything fits perfect on the iphone , very easy.i almost always get something underneath the screen protector when i 'm installing it however , no matter how careful i am.the screen protectors have been very durable and have been able to take quite a beating.this is a great value and so hard to find nowadays , where most screen protectors literally need a small manual to put them on your phone !

> antacid tablets have two uses for me . one , they relief heartburn which i get frequently and two , they provide 500mg of calcium.i 've actually been buying the goodsense brand of antacid tablets for quite awhile at one of my local stores . they are comparable to tums and honestly i ca n't tell a difference between the two brands but goodsense is cheaper.i like these tablets . they are thin , easy to take and not chalky . the assorted fruit flavors are pretty good . i like the fruit flavors over the some of the other flavors on the market.they always provide heartburn relief for me and i get the added benefit of the calcium . i ate these religiously while i was pregnant for both the heartburn and the calcium . i do n't have to take them as often as i did then but i still rely on them as my go to heartburn relief . they are also much cheaper to take as compared to lots of calcium supplements .

> while it takes up to twelve hours to initially charge up the battery , once it 's fully charged and the three blue lights go off on top , this battery pack can recharge other items multiple times before needing to be recharged . this comes in very handy during our famous arizona summer outages.the battery pack has the approximate size of a marlboro 100 cigarette pack ( see my photos under customer images ) . while dense in weight , as a battery pack this does as it should . i recommend this for anyone who travels a lot and/or who does not always have access to a power outlet.the pack comes with a small black carrier in which to place the enclosed adapters for the various devices mentioned . i use this primarily for my samsung tablet and my smart phone , both which use different adapters.i now have this pack in my travel bag.i received a free item for an honest review .

> when it comes to chocolate , i 've always preferred the dark chocolate . so , how dark is your dark chocolate ? well , i usually go for stuff that 's at least 70 % cacao . tonight , i spotted a ghirardelli intense dark bar . they call it midnight reverie and it 's 86 % cacao . i found it at a nearby fresh and easy market . man , that 's the darkest chocolate i 've ever seen . i just had to try it ! well , it 's intense , that 's for sure . wonderful chocolate flavor and definitely not a hershey bar . the bar has very little sweetness and is almost bitter . it 's hard to the bite and somewhat waxy . just the way i like chocolate ! how did i ever miss it on all my previous trips past the candy shelves ? gary peterson
= if you like really , really dark chocolate .
< wonderful chocolate flavor !

> i held off reading this book because everyone i knew who had read it or was reading it loved it but kept referring to it as `` depressing '' or `` violent '' or with other strong negative adjectives . i was n't in the mood for a `` downer . '' nothing else in my `` recommended for you '' list appealed to me so i downloaded the free sample . this book is everything everyone said it would be ... violence , cruelty , betrayal , death but somehow the story grabs you and wo n't let go . told by a 90 or 93 year old vet from a circus , the story is as personal as a biography and engrossing as a news account of the circus in the 1930s . i read it in 24 hours . buy , borrow it or download it ... it will not disappoint !

> this novel was , definitely the best find of 2001. it follows the story of elena michaels , a journalist as she struggles with her personal life , and her secret life as a 'werewolf . 'characterization is armstrong 's strong point . elena , jeremy , nick and clay are believable characters . they are werewolves without being 'super human . ' i particularly like the relationship between elena and the pack , and how clay does not patronize her because she is female , ( sigh ) which occurs in so many other novels.i listened to the audio-version , and the reader is dead on with the voices and characters . way to go ! i can barely wait for the sequel .

> this is the third splendid book by award winning author carole p. roman in which she cleverly introduces pre-k to age eight children to other lands than america and other cultures . this book focuses on south korea . roman shows a picture of south korea , identifies its capital as seoul , tells where it is in relation to other countries , what are usual korean names , korean money , interesting places , pastimes , holidays , foods , customs , and the like . since americans are criticized for being ignorant of other counties and cultures , this book is a good way to begin to overcome this problem .

> i was surprised to find how much i enjoyed this film starring some of the best of the united kingdom 's character actors . it has a well-told story , perfectly paced , with superb acting , much humor , and sentimentality . the theme is `` everything turns out well at the end , and if it does n't it is not the end . '' seven old men and women who have lost virtually all of their money and who are searching for some meaning in their life respond to a misleading advertisement that a hotel in india will give them an inexpensive and enjoyable stay , for it is the `` best '' and it is `` exotic .

> calliope reaper-jones tried her best to be a normal twenty-something living in new york , hoping to make it in the fashion world . but when her father 's assistant shows up , he tells callie that her father and sister have been kidnapped . then , she 's told that she must take her father 's place while trying to find out who 's responsible for his disappearance . but her father is death himself . and callie wants nothing to do with the job.written by the actress who played tara on buffy the vampire slayer television series , this is her first solo novel . callie is a spirited and fashion-focused young woman . in typical urban fantasy fashion , the novel is narrated by her , though callie is a bit more nave and not quite as courageous as most urban fantasy heroines . but i think this just adds to her charm and uniqueness . my one complaint is that she used the word `` not '' sarcastically twice . this was out-of-date two weeks after the saturday night live skit , and for some reason grates on my nerves to no end . but sometimes i nitpick.callie must complete three tasks in order to temporarily take her father 's place . and she has to face fantastical characters such as a hell hound , the devil 's prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; , former god and goddesses , not to mention find out who 's behind the kidnappings . with no lack of suspects , callie is definitely in over her head.death 's daughter was one of the most fun and exciting urban fantasies i 've read lately . with non-stop action and surprises , i ignored everything else to keep reading . urban fantasy fans are sure to enjoy this light-hearted and humorous new novel .

> i must begin by saying i personally do not find this to be a bad stapler , when all the basics are considered . but unfortunately this is the case of a little stapler wanting to be all fancy , which means the stapler must then be used all the time to meet its fancy nature , which means the stapler will probably get used more than is good for it . to be fair , i 'm only a huge fan of electric staplers when i 'm stapling one thing after another in a concentrated period of time -- because i have yet to meet an electric stapler that impresses me without throwing a tantrum on me.all the intricate adjustment settings do make this good for a busy office setting , though i think the smaller office or home wo n't need so many gizmos . it 's a sturdy stapler that wo n't get jostled about unduly , and the stapling occurs quickly . the 45 sheet capability is a nice perk and this indeed handles that many pages as promised.but ... after so long and so many uses ... one may find herself swearing and smacking the stapler as it eats staples or the paper so one finds herself tearing the paper out little by little . annoying , though less apt to happen if this stapler is reserved for special projects.again , i just prefer a manual stapler for my heavy-duty projects and this electric one does not seem up to heavy-duty long shifts . but for moderate use or special occasions , it would do the trick .

> if you 've never read any of these books , this is part of a space opera series , written by the always excellent bujold . i love her world building , so interesting and thought provoking , and i love her characters . this is an excellent book , the start of a long and complex series , go read it , it 's well worth it ! below is the spoiler , if you are not familiar with the series , do n't read just buy the book ! i 'd read quite of few of the miles vorkosigan novels before i came across this one , which is about his parents and how they met , and then the circumstances of his birth . ( i suddenly realized that this could be a spoiler because there was some concern about his birth , so hopefully a total newbie to this world stopped at the first paragraph ! ) i just loved cordelia and her betan perspective , in the closed and violent world of barrayar . i felt for all the characters but this is definitely cordelia 's book ( s ) even though aral , her love , miles ' father , is a huge part too . i 've reread this a few times , and always enjoy it , beautiful writing and great plot and fabulous worlds she 's created here . a pleasure to visit and revisit

> i practiced civil engineering for forty years , so i was looking forward to tackling the structural designs in simplephysics . it was fun , and although the app does honor the general principals of structural engineering , to actually design the structures in the app , you would need a lot of experience and more information about the properties of the materials ( and probably some structural engineering software ) . one thing that was very accurate was to create designs that could be built within a certain budget . even if your design works , the number of stars you 're awarded depends on how much under budget the structure is.but it is a fun app with enough & # 34 ; bells and whistles & # 34 ; to keep it interesting . there are a dozen structures , beginning with what appears to be a simple treehouse and becoming more complex as you move along . i still have n't completed all of the structures . the one i 'm having the toughest time with is to design a 24-story skyscraper to withstand 300 mph winds . do you make the structure as rigid as possible , or do you design it with the & # 34 ; bend but do n't break & # 34 ; approach ? the app will definitely keep you occupied for a while .

> this is a really interesting idea . i was afraid that it would be over engineered and not leave enough room for & # 34 ; play & # 34 ; . it 's ravensburger so i should have guessed it would be fine.we live in the snowy north so the kids only got to use this a few times before the driveway and walk were buried in snow and ice . they loved it and spent a great deal of time making these elaborate works of art . our only concern was once the chalks were worn down it was hard to get up to the edge of the stencil . just show your kids how to keep the chalk & # 34 ; sharp & # 34 ; by rotating it , after the snow fell i thought we would put this away until summer . but it has still been a favorite . the kids can use it in our unfinished basement.the stencils are high enough quality that this would be an awesome setting for painting a wall on the cheap . wall stencils are ridiculously expensive and no nicer than these.put the chalks in a big ziplock bag and then put that and the stencils in a huge ziplock bag . it keeps them neat and clean and minimizes breakage .

> sometimes i 'll be generally enjoying a book , but the author will do something that begins to annoy me . then every time he does that thing , i 'm a little more annoyed . i become sensitized to it and i begin to worry it like a sore tooth until i ca n't stand it anymore , and i have to quit reading that book.that 's what happened to me with the life of pi . in this case , it was lists . a list of swimming pools in france ( all but one of which have nothing to do with the story ) . a list of animals in the zoo . a list of piscine 's classmates . a list of how each animal in the zoo will kill or maim you . list after list after list.i gave up before pi ended up on the lifeboat with the tiger , which i knew from the movie . i was eager to reach this point in the story , but i found myself entangled in lists and stumbling before i got there.maybe when i retire and have more time to read , i 'll revisit this book . if it 's anything like the movie , there 's a great story in there somewhere .

> murder on st. mark 's place by victoria thompson is the second book in the gaslight mystery series featuring new york midwife sarah brandt . sarah investigates the death of a `` charity girl '' named gerda who got caught up in the glamorous , but dark underside of life in late 19th century new york city . and of course if sarah is involved , then detective sergeant frank malloy ca n't be far behind . sarah gets herself a little caught up in the seedy side of gerda 's life in trying to find the murderer 's identity and almost gets killed herself twice ! despite that bit of over-the-top , i enjoyed this mystery very much . thompson does a great job of getting inside sarah and frank 's heads and showing us their growing attraction and care for each other without either acknowledging it . sarah 's involvement in frank 's son 's brian 's life really helps keep the characters tied together emotionally as well . the twist at the end about the killer is fairly well projected . it 's another good solid entry in the series .

> this novel is a complicated mix of murder mystery , historical fiction , real world characters , mixed up with the introduction of the talkies ( motion pictures with sound ) , violent porn films , and the emergence of the nazi party . i had not read any of jonathan rabb 's previous books , but will definitely pick up a copy of rosa which has some of the same police characters investigating the murder of rosa luxemburg.the immediately post-metropolis fritz lang was a surprisingly effective character here . the fictional characters also have quite a bit of detail , but are not always as believable . all of the actors though take a backseat to a truly complex plot , with twists and turns all the way through.quite a good , but not quite excellent , novel that reminds me of a slightly darker , and perhaps more literary , martin cruz smith . ( though i notice someone else beat me to that punch in the reviews ! )

> much has been written about the critical and commercial fiasco of `` heaven 's gate '' ( 1980 ) . director michael cimino 's misguided epic not only contributed to the downfall of united artists , but almost single-handedly destroyed the western genre . ( luckily , clint eastwood helped save the day with `` pale rider '' and `` unforgiven . '' ) perhaps a good film might have emerged from the johnson county wars . however , `` heaven 's gate '' is an overlong mess - with excessive subtitles , inexplicable nudity , and clouds of dust that obscure the climactic action . the film certainly has its defenders , but the finished product is a depressing waste of time , money and talent . what was cimino thinking ?

> when one compiles a list of the great sci-fi films of the fifties , that list must include `` them ! '' and `` beast from 20,000 fathoms . '' besides being made during the same decade , the two films have so much in common:1 ) they were both produced and released by warner brothers.2 ) both feature actors in supporting roles as the `` old scientist , '' edmund gwenn in `` them '' and cecil kellaway in `` beast '' , respectively.3 ) both films have then-state-of-the-art special effects , though `` beast '' sports the best with the handiwork of the legendary ray harryhausen on his first `` solo '' project.4 ) the `` monsters '' in both films were the result of atomic bomb testing , a plot device stemmed from the fear fostered in many following the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945.5 ) both films have the necessary female `` expert '' to `` equal things out , joan weldon ( `` them ! '' ) and paula raymond ( `` beast '' ) . weldon even gets to do the required scream when saved from the marauding ant hordes.what 's fun about both is that viewers get to see some novice performers who would later make their mark on television or the big screen . `` them ! '' stars future-matt-dillon james arness and in supporting roles future-davy-crockett-and-daniel boone fess parker as well as leonard nimoy would would later don pointed eyes as the legendary mr. spock . `` `` beast '' has future movie star lee van cleef as a marksman that brings down the monster.still-going-strong-at-87 character actor william schallert has a small part in `` them ! `` , also.the picture and sound is very good for films that are fifty-plus years old.the extras include a fascinating conversation between harryhausen and longtime friend ray bradbury whose `` the fog '' was the inspiration for `` beast .

> oliver stone has proven that the third time is the charm . his second `` restructuring '' of his 2004 film is much better than the previous two , even with the additional footage . stone has crafted a film that is both contemporary as well as traditional as it tells the tale of one of the greatest conquerors in world history . perhaps , it is better viewed at home , allowing the viewer to savor the cinematography , the opulent sets , the well-choreographed battle scenes , the magnificent costumes , and the acting , a combination of the over-the-top and the subdued.speaking of the acting , many have been critical of colin farrell in the title role . the `` revisitation '' puts his performance in a better balance , permitting one to view his empassioned acting in a different perspective . many it 's not oscar-worthy but his take on the historical character is pretty darn good . he is matched by angelina jolie as his mother , omega , in a most interesting interpretation which must be respected for its uniqueness . other outstanding acting turns are given by rosario dawson as alexander 's wife , roxane , gary stretch as clietus , val kilmer as phillip , christopher plummer as aristotle , jared leto as hephaistio , and conner paolo as the young alexander.the jaw-dropping special effects , especially the re-enactment of the historical battles are stunning . one ca n't help but wonder `` how did they do that ? '' when watching the battle between alexander 's minions against elephant-riding opponents in the jungles of india.the movie , in this final incarnation , may not rank among the top-ten greatest epics of all time but it now can lay claim to being a pretty darn good film .

> as i began reading this book i could not help but think of dean koontz 's the taking . the two are similar in theme and share some descriptions . this book is told from the point of view of an old man living in the appalachians . it has been raining continuously all over the world for more than forty days . what is n't flooded is damp . mold and fungus are growing on everything . it is not imagined that things could get any worse . but they do.the continuous rain has driven giant worms to the surface . first they are only as big around as dogs . but larger and larger worms show up . these worms are not content with drawing nourishment from the dirt . instead they have taken to eating anything that moves ; birds , cows , people . then , unlike most horror novels , the cast begins to grow and we get glimpses of what has been going on elsewhere . we also get glimpses of what might be causing the destruction.as with the earlier novels i have read by brian keene , the action does not stop until the last page . i do not know if this tale will be followed up as the rising was followed by city of the dead , but this one has a more satisfying ending than the rising although not as final as in the later . since the book opens just as things are really getting bad , there is little time wasted on a slow build . instead it starts pretty fast and picks up speed . if you liked his earlier books , you are sure to like this one .

> in addition to his unparalleled record as a promoter of mathematics , martin gardner has also applied his considerable writing and intellectual skills to the never-ending crusade against pseudoscience . this book is a collection of some of his more memorable entries in the `` notes of a fringe watcher '' column that appeared in `` the skeptical inquirer . '' as is always the case with gardner , the writing and his arguments are so crisp that it is difficult to believe that anyone could read them and be unconvinced as to the correctness of his position . unfortunately , the pendulum always seems to be skewed towards a belief in the bunk rather than the intellectual reality . therefore , no matter how much the evidence is in favor of a position , there will always be people who will dismiss that evidence out of hand.there are 28 different chapters in this book , covering all areas where pseudoscience rears its ' empty cranium . from creationism to the therapeutic properties of drinking ones own urine , i can not think of an area of pseudoscience that gardner does not address . however , i am sure that some do exist , after all , not even gardner is perfect and there are so many of them . this is a book that should be read by every thinking , intelligent person .

> these sleeves for kindles are probably a good idea for anyone who wants to use their kindle without anything surrounding it . however what i found is that they do not give the protection of a case . they tend to slip out if they are not carried upright . the insides are very soft so they do not scratch the screen but there is nothing on top of the case - a snap or any type of closure to keep your device from falling out , if for example you would pull it out of a briefcase in the wrong way.the other problem with the case is that if you have a screen protector it rubs against the edges eventually and helps to loosen it . they just do not provide as much protection for your device , even as you are holding it and of course they do not help to prop it up on a table or desk as you might need to do sometimes .

> this is a good tasting cup of medium strength coffee that has a hint and taste of kahlua in it . we like that with the keurig you can pop in a k-cup and make a cup or two in just a few minutes . we make the large cup and sometimes split it as an after dinner coffee or as a special treat in the middle of the day.the taste of kahlua is just right in the coffee and we both like it . i like that you can get the taste of kahlua without the alcohol in the drink . we recommend it to you . i have posted a photo for your information .

> i love thrillers . i also love baseball . the combination of the two proved irresistible to me even though this book is neither a great thriller nor a great baseball book . frey keeps the story moving in james patterson-like fashion ; there are lots of short chapters and lots of different characters featured in each chapter . it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out the plot-twists ahead , but if you 're a fan of both baseball and thrillers you 'll be hooked.a very entertaining read , but not one that 's likely to win any prizes .

> `` 3:10 to yuma '' is a western film , directed by james mangold of `` walk the line '' fame . the film is also a remake of the 1957 delmer daves film , which i have n't seen . well , this is what i have read before watching the film , but what really interested me most was the name of the original story 's writer - elmore leonardbased on the 1953 elmore leonard short story `` three-ten to yuma , '' the new film adaptation follows the story of dan evans ( christian bale ) , an impoverished small-time rancher living in arizona . when an outlaw ben wade ( russell crowe ) is arrested at the nearby town , dan takes up the dangerous job of delivering the captured outlaw to the train ( a 3:10 departure to yuma ) with the guards including pinkerton agent byron mcelroy ( peter fonda ) for 200 dollars . but ben 's henchman led by the ruthless charlie prince ( ben foster ) may attack at any moment to retrieve ben and kill the rest of all.james mangold 's `` 3:10 to yuma '' tries to be a character-driven drama and action-packed western at the same time . the changing relation between dan evans and ben wade plays a pivotal role in the tense storyline that is filled with plot twists , and as if to emphasize the tension , actions ( including a gatling gun ) are often bloody and violent.but what makes the film so wonderful is the compelling acting from the cast , especially the two charismatic leads russell crowe and christian bale . their fascinating performances have made the complex characters possible . after all this is elmore leonard 's world in which there is no simple good or evil , and you need someone with genuine talent and experience to realize that . `` 3:10 to yuma '' is a nice addition to the western genre . it has actions and interesting characters .

> i 've read this book a couple of times and the truths of this book never cease to amaze me . very similar to orwell 's 1984 , this is the visionary look of what happens when government has too much power to control our lives and censure our media . in this story , books are the source of evil because they encourage free thinking and contain ideas that discourage the ideals of this government 's philosophies . to control what people think , books are banned and burned by firemen . firemen , as far as people believe ( because books do n't exist that disprove this ) , have always been around , burning books to protect the public from the evils they portray . this is the story of guy montag , who is a fireman.guy montag lives the life of any dedicated fireman . he does his job , pretends to be happy , and spends much of his income on tv walls so his wife can have more people in her `` family '' in which to converse with ( and be controlled by ) .his life changes when he meets his seventeen year-old , free-thinking neighbor , clarisse . guy 's eyes are open to a new world as he finds a new love for thinking for himself and discovering the wonders of books.this book has really appealed to me of late because of my own new-found love in books . if you do n't appreciate having libraries in every town and an endless supply of books in which to enrich your imagination then you need to read this book so you can imagine what life would be like if books were banned along with your ability to think for yourself . consider this a must read .

> `` death on the barrens '' is author george james grinnell 's dramatic and thoughtful account of a 1955 canoe expedition down the dubawnt river in sub-arctic canada , through a remote region rightly known as the barrens . the expedition was led by arthur moffat , an experienced wilderness canoist , and included five young men , most with little experience in the wild . the expedition got off to a late start and wound up racing the oncoming winter and dwindling food supplies to a tragedy near its destination.grinnell 's account is compelling on at least two levels . the trouble that overtook the expedition was easily foreseeable ; the narrative at times has the macabre quality of watching a horrifying accident in slow motion . on another level , the narrative explores the expedition as a spiritual journey . the emotionally unstable grinnell grows from youth to man in the face of challenge . more subtly , he also travels a mystic path to arrive , briefly , at a place of inner peace . his experience is possibly shared , to one degree or another , by other members of the expedition.grinnell 's account is the product of half a century of meditation on what happened , an attempt to wrest meaning from that tragedy and a like event that overtook the author 's children . readers of peter mathiessen 's `` the snow leopard '' may find some similarities of insight . this reviewer wishes the author had included better maps and a mention of the fates of the other members of the expedition . `` death on the barrens '' is very highly recommended .

> idris elba did such an outstanding job playing luther in this series that he has been able to parlay it into a major acting career in both movies and tv . you will now see him in the cast of major motion pictures whereas just a few years ago no one knew who he was . luther is a homicide inspector in london , he is unconventional and haunted . at times both his boss and his colleagues would just like to see the back end of him . the thing is though , when facing what seems to be an insoluble problem , luther thinks so far outside of the box that the insoluble becomes solved . this series is another murder investigation . if this sounds same old-same old to you , there are two developments i guarantee will keep you riveted to your seat . one , luther has to handle a malovelent madam to release a young girl from her prostitution clutches . doing this shows a combination of tenderness and ruthlessness . two , in a segment you will never forget , luther walks down a london street talking to a perp while pouring gasoline from a can all over himself , taunting him over how much fun he can have making him into a human torch ,

> usually i 'm not into the mystery genre , but between this series and tana french 's irish detective novels , i 'm coming around . you probably already know a lot about girl with the dragon tattoo given what a cultural phenomenon it 's become , so all i 'll say is that as a non-mystery reader , i really enjoyed this book.it takes a while to get into ; as with most mystery novels the set up is complex and builds very slowly . however , even during the build-up you can appreciate the experiential feeling of scandinavian atmosphere in this series . the subdued , dark ( in more ways than one ) atmosphere sticks with you long after you finish the book . it 's definitely a violent book as you probably know , but i would say it 's a positive book for women given the strong female heroine and the unflinching look at the underlying masochism still just beneath the surface of our modernized society .

> i had no knowledge about the historical aspect of orphan trains when i began this book . although it is a work of fiction , it is grounded in the historical reality of a movement which took city orphans and farmed them out to families in the upper midwest as adoptees - which often meant a live of servitude and abuse , but at times was a positive experience.this book is very well written , it is a novel and it imparts the information about the orphan trains through the course of the story . characters are well developed and the plot is very engaging and strong.having read this book provoked me to do some google searching about the orphan trains and there is considerable fascinating information out there . i felt this book both entertained me , and educated me and provoked me to learn more - a true trifecta of value in my opinion.i highly recommend this interesting book .

> the pitch for this book is misleading . i chose this because of the line `` ... the novel 's sharp and sparkly humor will have you laughing during its darkest moments , '' even though i never laughed , but cringed instead . the story of a sad little rich kid who is emotionally and physically abused by her spoiled mother gets old by page two , as the story starts out with bettina recalling her life with mom in chicago . she is ten years old . her mother cusses , smokes , takes drugs and sleeps around and treats her daughter like an unwanted nuisance . the novel ends with her being 26 years old and still fighting to win approval of her mother . her privileged life in an upscale boarding house did her no good.bettina knows she is not a normal person , not after the young life she has had . her mother has an open affair that haunts her all through the story , with repercussions as well . she started smoking only because that was the only thing she shared with her mother babs . she feels awkward making small talk with people because her relationships up to then were about money , sex and drugs . the storyline from bettina 's point of view evolves around her always wanting acceptance from those she loves , and in the end she loses everyone she had loved in life . this is definitely not a feel-good story and it 's certainly not a standard coming-of-age book . the characters are all badly flawed and the end seems open ; bettina does n't seem to come to grips with her heritage or her identity.for those bothered by repeated sex and/or obscenities , i recommend to forgo this book . for those who enjoy poor little rich girl dilemmas , this may be a satisfying read .

> i purchased this to augment a pair ofwinsome wood 24-bottle beechwood wine rack/glass holderthat had quickly filled with bottles . aesthetically this did not quite fit in due to color variations and height , but it is still a great rack for a great price.pluses include : attractive , sturdy and stable , and very small footprint . as you can see from my customer-supplied image and those uploaded by others this rack takes up very little floor space.the only negative is it will not hold a bottle over 750ml . this is not a problem for me , but if you are planning to store 1 or 1.5 liter bottles in it you will be disappointed.assembly was a breeze for me , but this is not the first one i 've assembled . if you have a helper to hold one section steady while inserting the short pieces that connect and brace the main assemblies you will have it together in less than ten minutes . here is a tip : before assembling take the time to wipe each piece of this rack down withold english furniture polish : scratch cover for light woodand let them thoroughly dry before assembling . you will thank yourself later . this step makes all of the difference between this being a wood wine storage unit and an attractive piece of furniture to display your collection.you can not go wrong if you want a compact , attractive rack to store 750ml or smaller bottles of wine . if you absolutely need a rack that can store larger bottles check the other model i mentioned at the beginning of this review . they will definitely do the job . i also own two of those and highly recommend them as well .

> i had overlooked this recording for years , thinking that a non-russian pianist , now largely forgotten , could n't accomplish anything better done by richter , kissin , and a host of others . but in fact philippe entremont understands rachmaninov 's idiom in a clear-sighted , unsentimental way , and he has tehcnique to burn for the big-voiced climaxes and rapid passagework . the real secret here is bernstein . there are almost no great conductors who have paid anything like this kind of attention to the rachmaninov second , yet he is passionate , considerate of his soloist , and gripping from first bar to last . the sonics are fine for their era , if a bit brittle . all in all this bargain cd comes as a huge surprise to me -- it 's a feast of genuine emotion rather than russian shmaltz.i am no judge of the rachmaninov 3rd , since i rarely get through a listen even when the pianist is a great one ( e.g. , volodos with levine , kissin with ozawa , and of course the composer himself ) . but i did like ozawa 's light hand with the accompaniment here , as well as the ny phil 's superb execution . watts is every inch the glittering virtuoso , but his approach sounds a bit neutral -- he does n't lavish much individuality as fistfuls of notes tumble by . sony 's sonics are full and natural , so at the very least this is a gorgeous-sounding account .

> the librarian : quest for the spear ( peter winther , 2004 ) did anyone really bother to think this through ? i find it rather doubtful.the librarian : quest for the spear , silly name that it has , stars noah wyle ( er ) as indiana jones , trekking through the amazon jungle with a gorgeous sidekick ( sonya walger , from the wasn't-aborted-nearly-soon-enough american version of coupling ) . the two of them originally ca n't stand each other , but eventually get to be quite a partnership . woo . they 're being pursued by some baddies who are after the same thing they are , but are quite content to sit back and let wyle and walger do all the work . why has n't an action hero yet decided to sit back and let the bad guys do all the work , then pluck the item in question from their hands when they 've faced all the dangers ? so anyway , does it all sound familiar ? it should . you 've seen it in a million movies , from douglas fairbanks on down . there are some good ancillary roles , especially bob newhart as an unassuming caretaker-type , but noah wyle is a little too homey even to play the reluctant-action-hero role here ; he always looks like he 's out of his depth with the character , rather than the character being out of his depth with the situations.just really all-around badly done . **

> having read and enjoyed two other ethan gage novels , i.e . the dakota cipher and the rosetta key , i was eager to read this latest installment in the adventure series . part of what draws me to dietrich 's ethan gage books is the historical details and the high sense of atmosphere and adventure . this author 's main strength is in setting up and writing thrilling action scenes , and i like to just lose myself in the adventure and daydream.ethan gage makes a likable hero , the sort you want to root for , and i love all the period details ( some might find this tiresome , but i enjoy reading minute details ) . since it is a historical action thriller , some readers might wonder about the authenticity of the period details . frankly , i would not really be able to identify these unless it is blatantly obvious , but when i pick a work of historical fiction , i 'm more interested in the setting and atmosphere , which dietrich excels at . final verdict - a rollicking good thrill ride !

> this soundtrack album from the movie glitter starring mariah carey in her film debut really does rock ! it was originally scheduled for release on august 21,2001 but she was in no condition to promote it then . she had a nervous breakdown and needed to take it easy with her career and recover . it had been delayed three weeks and coincided with the day of the terrorist attacks . now for the songs : i did n't mean to turn you on was a hit for the now-deceased robert palmer in 1986. mariah 's cover sounds like a prince recording from the early or mid-80 's . loverboy , also the remix , sounds cool . so does last night a dj saved my life , if we and never to far . mariah had gone from columbia records to virgin on this album . she had been dropped from virgin after this album .

> sick of enduring the constant fix-up attempts of her mother and other well-meaning people , debra daniels is desperate for a solution . when she stumbles across a novelty gift entitled `` fianc & eacute ; at your fingertips '' that 's guaranteed to fool family and friends into thinking you have a steady boyfriend , she thinks it 'll be a great joke . unfortunately , the only kit the store has is `` lawyer logan . '' despite her dislike of lawyers , debra buys the kit and puts the plan into action . everyone seems to be fooled and she 's having a great time . until lawyer logan actually shows up ... fianc & eacute ; at her fingertips was an incredibly frustrating book because it had so much potential . the idea of the relationship kit was really cute . despite debra 's ( and kathleen bacus ' ) overuse of alliteration , i liked her -- at least at first . her job as a crime victims ' advocate was admirable , and she was funny . her shock and horror at the appearance of a real logan alexander was amusing for a while . as for logan , he was sweet , kind , funny , generous , and all in all a wonderful guy . i wanted to smack debra when she continued to treat logan horribly for most of the story . then , just when i thought there was a perfect place to end the story , it took an unpleasant twist . the happy ending rang false for me because of it . still , fianc & eacute ; at her fingertips had a lot of good points . the idea was good , i loved the hero , and the supporting characters were hilarious . i am hoping ms. bacus 's next book in what promises to be a series will capitalize on all those positives.cassiereviewed for joyfully reviewed

> i feel guilty giving this tosca five stars , since nothing here rises to the highest level , but if leontyne price had n't already recorded the opera in 1962 , we would marvel at her portrayal here . her voice is so innately thrilling and beautiful that only tebaldi comes close for puccinian vocal splendor . about a decade after her early prime , price entered a partnership with the young domingo on rca that resulted in a flood of wonderful recordings . the best feature conducting by james levine ( la forze del destino ) and zubin mehta ( tosca ) .price 's 1962 tosca on decca is stronger in three ways : the vienna phil. , karajan as conductor , and price herself in better voice . but the cavaradossi of di stefano , then only 41 , is strained and frayed of voice , while the scarpia of giuseppe taddei also shows signs of wear . this rca set repairs those defects with two great voices in their prime to support price , for besides domingo we ca n't leave out milnes . his scarpia is n't venomous enough ; he 's a bit prone to bellowing . even so , his tone and technique are commanding , far superior , in fact , to the legendary tito gobbi , who triumphed through vocal acting and characterization.so , if you are choosing which of price 's toscas to buy , the choice will have to be persoanl . for vocal thrills from all the principals , this rca set is at the top of the list . for artistry on the podium and the amazing voice of price in her very prime , the decca set is unsurpassed .

> in appearance and feel , there is not much difference between this gaming mouse and the g9 gaming mouse . however , you can adjust the sensitivity of the mouse for gaming by creating up to five mouse profiles and you can determine the sensitivity you want , so your arrow can zip across your screen super-fast or go slower , depending on what kind of game you are involved in . the g9x has the enhanced laser which makes for more accurate gaming . once you have that under control , your gaming precision is sure to get faster and more accurate.as far as simply being a good mouse , it still has great features . like the g9 , there is a choice between a wider or thinner mouse grip . ( i use the wider one as my hands are large and i have always had trouble with thinner mice ) . plus , you can add weight to the mouse ( up to 28 g ) , which is something i had never thought would be such a great advantage until i used it . the bulk and the sensitivity really improve handling . the scroll wheel can be adjusted to either a smooth or a click response ( i prefer the click ) . just the velvety feel and the wider grip make a huge difference . this might seem minor , but the cord is braided which makes it easy to distinguish when plugging and unplugging in the back of my desktop . in short , this version of gaming mouse is better than the g9 since it contains the gaming profiles and the enhanced laser ( in software installation ) .

> have you ever wished to live in or visit other parts of the world ? i love to travel , and have often thought about living in another country . the united states is a melting pot of different peoples with different nationalities . it is a good thing , indeed , to learn about other cultures , other languages and other countries . in this way , we can become better neighbors and better friends.carole roman , the author , was a teacher and has children of her own . i truly love her books . she introduces us to other ways of living and to other people with her books . this is particularly important for children to learn about others , how they live and what good friends they can become , before preconceived ideas have formed . in this book we learn all about mexico , it 's language , it 's capital , the food , the fun places to visit , what children call their mamas and papas . mexico is not far from several of our southwestern states . it would be nice to learn how to get along with other people . an extra added attraction is the glossary , where we learn the pronunciation of the words that are introduced . the illustrations are beautiful , colorful and vivid , and give us a wonderful depiction of the land called mexico . this book can be a learning experience for parents/children and teachers/children . discussions of mexican culture , founds , clothing and words can be a lot of fun . note : this book was given to me to read and review.recommended . prisrob

> `` dreams from my father '' is an eloquent , poignant memoir of pres . barack obama 's search for his enigmatic kenyan father . the memoir brings up questions of identity , be they familial or racial . obama 's story is incredibly moving and powerful , since it shows the consequences of a broken home . he deals with the racism of his white relatives , who disdain him as a mixed race child , his father 's polygamy , his mother 's remarriage to an indonesian , and his own questions . his father abandoned him at a young age ; it traumatizes him to the point he makes a pilgrimage to kenya . kenya is n't exactly an african paradise ; there , too , he sees stereotyping and prejudice . `` dreams from my father '' also covers obama 's mentor , the controversial rev . jeremiah wright , along with the mysterious `` frank '' , who taught him about socialism . for a fatherless son , the government supplants the shattered family . obama 's search for his paternity is a perennial one . everyone has a deep father-longing . it 's a humanizing aspect of the memoir , in the face of how obama has been raised to a messianic level by his followers.when obama wrote `` dreams '' , he was still at harvard . he had n't yet become a community organizer in chicago . who knew that this memoir would be a stepping stone to the white house ...

> i am going to try to refrain from heaping the same superlatives on this album that other reviewers have bestowed . they are all true , but i prefer to let the sound samples on this page tell the story - and a great story they tell.this album came to my attention completely by serendipitous accident : i purchased a value-priced , two album set titledalone togetherand this was one of the two albums . on first listen i was in love . in fact , until this album i had always considered art blakey and the jazz messengers ' rendition of dizzy gillespie 's night in tunisia to be the definitive version . after listening to the performance in this album i am not as certain . one of the things that makes that track - and the rest of them on this album - work is the solid rhythm section comprised of red garland on piano , oscar pettiford on bass and philly joe jones on drums . they give miles the freedom to take the melody on every track to places that only he can with his tone and style.this album was recorded for prestige at rudy van gelder 's hackensack , nj studio on june 7 , 1955. i strongly encourage you to check out the two-album set i mentioned above before making a final purchase decision because it contains another album that was recorded two days later and together they are a wonderful listening experience .

> lucy kendall returns from a tour of the continent , her luggage filled with the latest fashions and a mind fired by inspiration . after tasting europe 's best confections , she 's sure she 'll come up with a recipe that will save her father 's struggling candy business and reverse their fortunes . but she soon discovers that their biggest competitor , the cheat who swindled her father out of his prize recipe , has now hired a promotions manager -- a cocky , handsome out-of-towner who gets under lucy 's skin.charlie clarke 's new role at standard manufacturing is the chance of a lifetime . he can put some rough times behind him and reconnect with the father he 's never known . the one thing he never counted on , however , was tenacious lucy kendall . she 's making his work life miserable ... and making herself impossible for him to forget.the premise behind unrivaled seemed interesting . rival candy makers -- who can beat that ? but the story starts out with her returning from her european tour to find out her father had had a heart attack and was n't recovering right . the aunt and uncle seemed selfish as they would n't even tell her until they arrived at her house . they did n't consider cutting the trip short despite the family emergency.despite the candy industry , i remained detached from the characters and story . both the hero and heroine seemed ruthless . with them virtual enemies throughout the story , it seemed rather contrived that they 'd fall in love so quickly at the end.the story is written in first person , with clear headings as to whose point of view we 're in -- lucy 's , charlie 's . . . if you like historical fiction and a romance with two strong cut-throat characters , then unrivaled is a book to consider . 3.5 stars .

> `` red eye '' is a fast-paced thriller directed by wes craven , who also directed the fabulous `` scream '' trilogy . in `` red eye , '' a young hotel manager named lisa ( rachel mcadams ) is kidnapped by a man ( cillian murphy ) she encounters on a late flight to miami . the strange man is part of a plot to assassinate a homeland security official ( jack scalia ) at the hotel where lisa works . lisa is instructed to call the hotel and arrange to have the government official 's room switched , making it easier for the assassination plot to be carried out . there 's a hit man sitting outside the home of lisa 's father , and if lisa refuses to comply with her hostage , her father will be killed.overall , this is a pretty decent movie . it clocks in at only 85 minutes long , which is brilliant : craven constantly keeps the action moving , and there is n't a dull moment in the film . both mcadams and murphy deliver excellent performances in their roles and have great onscreen chemistry together . i was pretty turned off by almost every other actor in the film , though : all the other performances seemed very overdone , which must have been a deliberate choice on craven 's part , but i found it kind of annoying.this is an entertaining and suspenseful film . it 's not up there with my favorite thrillers of all time and i doubt i 'll ever watch it again , but `` red eye '' kept me thoroughly entertained for 85 minutes of my life .

> what a tour de force this book is ! i have read it many , many times over the last 40+ years and each time i discover some new morsel to savor . the writing is spare , with each word exactly right . mattie ross was an unlikely heroine back in the days when nancy drew was more the norm . she is young , naive , smart , pious , and brave . then there is rooster cogburn - a shaggy , drunken reprobate who nonetheless falls under mattie 's spell . texas ranger labeouf got just way too much enjoyment out of walloping mattie and i have a hard time stomaching him in the book or either film . i enjoy the story being told by mattie as an older woman , reminiscing about long ago events . love , love this book - the all american classic.i have also seen both versions of the film based on this book . while the new version by the coen brotherstrue grit ( blu-ray/dvd combo + digital copy ) is very faithful to the book , nothing will ever beat the original with john waynetrue grit [ blu-ray ] ( in my opinion ) . the casting in the original movie was perfect , down to each and every character ( excepting one - glen campbell as labeouf - worthless ) . john wayne and kim darby will always be the characters i picture when i read the book . and even though the setting did n't follow the book in the john wayne version , the scenery was beyond spectacular .

> i bought this to try out because i was on the fence as to whether i wanted to replace my 60 & # 34 ; tv with a new smart tv . i am glad that i decided to do this first . i watch a lot of stuff on netflix , hulu , and youtube . it is by far the best way to get these on my non-smart tv . the box comes with everything you need to get started . if your tv does not have a usb port it even comes with a adapter so you can plug it into a wall socket . the set up was quick and easy , and took less than 5 minutes . it works wirelessly so there is no need to have ethernet cable to my tv . you can also stream your music from google play or pandora as well . i just ordered two more devices for my other home tv 's this way no matter what room i 'm in , or my family can watch one thing in one room on netflix and i can watch a different movie on another tv . another benefit is that anything i can bring up in my chrome browser i can put on the tv . so i can show people my pictures or bring up a web page for all to see . i have even done my gmail with it . i would recommend this product to all my friends . for $ 35 this is by far the best value out there .

> just when it appeared the fd franchise had run out of steam and should retire , fd5 comes along and says `` we ai n't dead yet ! '' . and by god , they 're right . fd5 is the best entry since the first and in some ways , it 's the best of them all . there 's a darker undertone and not as much humor in this one . the opening disaster on the suspension bridge is extremely well done -- it 's nervewracking , jawdropping and even though it 's just under five minutes , it seems endless and really horrifying . eschewing the usual vapid teen characters , we get young business professionals as our doomed survivors . the cast does a good job in bringing a little more diversity than usual and the chain of events leading to the gruesome deaths is inventive and suspenseful . as for the ending , i did not see that coming ! ! not to mention the new `` rule '' tony todd slyly interjects that adds a sinister twist.i really enjoyed fd5 and if they can keep the franchise going at this level , i 'll be right there.p.s . fans of tv 's bold and the beautiful who really hate the character of steffi ( played by the foxy jacqueline mcinnes wood ) will find a ghoulish satisfaction in her grim demise !

> i took a real hunch on this one . you see , in australia , we do n't get this show - we are the last in the universe to get anything good and no one here has probably even heard of it . i had heard so many good things about this , that i took the risk and bought it . i knew i liked jeremy piven and kevin dillon ( who plays a guy jealous of his brother , but he 's got a real good heart and is funny and well acted ) and knowing the subject matter , i trusted the good things i heard and my gut feelings . i am so happy i got this . it 's excellent , and funny , seemingly realistic and really well written . no wonder jeremy has been nominated for an emmy . i hope he gets it . his character is sleazy and fun to watch . you love to hate him . watch for great cameo appearances from various actors . it 's a fun show , set in la and produced by mark wahlberg who 's probably had an entourage or two himself in his life . get this and watch it all the way through if you have n't already seen it . even if you have , you will want to watch it again i bet .

> robert wise made a gripping , harrowing and mercurial study of alienation in the human physique . a surprisingly and perfect film in its genre , there is a lot of hidden tributes to previous movies such as beauty and the beast , the fall of usher . if not for a champion picture that would arrive just two years later - roman polanski ` s repulsion - this film would have shared honors with s & eacute ; ance on a wet afternoon and woman in the dunes among the most remarkable films of that decade or any other.if you add the impressive performances of julie harris and claire bloom . the male characters work out as support.. finally we have to acknowledge the astonishing camera work , the use of lenses that deform the reality and the fabulous artistic direction , blended with a perfect script , you will have to admit there is not any hole in this treasured jewel of this gifted director , who made his debut in this genre : robert wise.a true masterpiece .

> the bottom line : i went into this movie expecting to hate it due to the book 's deplorably 1950s brand of gender relations and oh-so-tired sexy vampire motif but was pleasantly surprised to find that the film is more mediocre than out-and-out bad ; boasting some cool shots ( bella and edward in the treetops , the baseball game in the storm ) and some terrible ones ( edward sucking the venom out of bella at the end , edward convulsing when she walks into class ) the film version of twilight is less awful than it could be , and that 's the best compliment i can think of for it.2.5/4

> escapade in florence ( 1962 ) was one of several enjoyable assignments for disney 's teen stars annette funicello and tommy kirk . their teamings were always particularly special , and to this day , their co-starring films ( including the popular `` merlin jones '' titles and `` the shaggy dog '' ) are amongst the best of the classic live action 'walt-era ' canon.the plot of escapade in florence is slight but padded out with enjoyable annette musical numbers and some slapstick chases . tommy carpenter ( kirk ) is a student of architecture on scholarship in florence , who accidentally runs his bright-red vespa into annette aliotto ( funicello ) , a feisty young art student who lives with an aunt and uncle in their trattoria and sings there ( naturally ) in her spare time.after taking an interest in one of annette 's paintings , he becomes suspicious when he is prevented from buying it from the tourist store where it is for sale . pretty soon , he uncovers why - annette 's paintings ( and all the other students ' works from her academy ) have original masterpieces elaborately concealed underneath them ! tommy , annette and their friends now must outwit an art forgery ring ( run by ivan desny ) .originally intended as a special 2-part episode of the `` disneyland wonderful world of colour '' tv series , escapade in florence was released theatrically in the united kingdom , australia and other foreign markets . a kind of 'junior miss ' `` rome adventure '' , the film has developed a reputation as one of annette 's rarer titles because of it 's relative unavailability on home video since it 's 'neon mickey ' vhs release in 1985-86. i 'd love for disney to have included it in their ( apparently now discontinued ) treasures series , perhaps teamed with the other annette/tommy `` disneyland '' special `` the horsemasters '' . guess my vhs copy will have to last for a few more years.recommended for annette and old-school disney fans .

> the manner in which halloween is celebrated in england , with its games , masks , and its emphasis on the macabre , disgusts poirot . the name halloween means the eve of saints ( day ) . all saints day occurs on november 1. it is a solemn day designed in the roman catholic tradition to remember all of the saints . halloween occurs on the prior eve , on october 31. perverting this holy day with macabre frivolity can only lead to trouble . and it did . a young girl is murdered and poirot is called in to investigate and identify the murderer in this well-told , interesting , and sometimes humorous tale.the young girl had blurted out during a halloween party , surrounded by many children and some adults , that she saw a murder committed some years back . they all laugh at her because she had lied in the past . but shortly thereafter , during the party , she is found dead , drowned in the apple dunking bowl . poirot discovers that there had been three deaths in the village in the past three years and one disappearance . the first to die was a very old rich woman who did not leave her fortune to her relatives , but to her au pair . the will giving the estate to her relatives had been superseded by a codicil , which was soon shown to be a clumsy forgery . this au pair soon disappeared . a man with a criminal past was stabbed in the back . a school teacher drowned . are all four incidents related , just some of them , or none ? what did the child see ? was she telling the truth ? can poirot unravel the mystery ?

> i had read `` concrete blonde '' about a year and a half ago , not knowing it was the third book in the harry bosch series . now , i have read the first two bosch books , and see how good a book `` the concrete blonde '' is . bosch is as always a well-developed and complex `` hero '' or `` anithero . '' at least in this one , chief irvin seems to be a little more understanding and appreciative of bosch . bosch also shows his sensitive side as he refuses to the ruin the career of a fellow cop who leaks information to the sharp lawyer , honey daniels.the book balances the courtroom action and the new dollmaker case with marvelous dialogue and scenarios . it 's hard to really judge harry on what he did with the dollmaker four years ago . was he right ? is he a cowboy ? does he really like death and violence ? these questions are n't quite answered , but we still get a feeling of what harry 's gone through since this case started . bosch also solidifies his relationiship with sylvia , the ex-wife of a cop who was featured in `` black ice . '' the ending intimates more to come in this regard.my favorite character in this one is `` hans off '' , the administratively proficient , but criminally incompetent , lead investigator . he is good at getting a coffee pot in the team 's unit , but ca n't think of anything on his own . a sharp character . in fact , connelly 's supporting cast is always very well developed.a great read , now on to the `` the last coyote . `` highly recommended

> first off the author makes it very clear that her book is part memoir , part expos & eacute ; of sexual issues in the time period she grew up in . period.and having split my time between a small island in washington state where i took the ferry to seattle to attend an all girls school and here in northern california not far from san francisco i could 100 % identify with a lot of what the author wrote about and shared.yes , she grew up in a middle class home with academia parents , as i did . yes , she got the same mixed messages i and my peers did . but again this is about her life and her life experiences . if you dont want to hear about them , then dont read the book.but her books appeal to me because of her views . and in reading this book i came to appreciate her other books , the beauty myth : how images of beauty are used against women and misconceptions : truth , lies , and the unexpected on the journey to motherhood and promiscuities a secret history of female and the treehouse : eccentric wisdom from my father on how to live , love , and see even more.in fact it is like viewing the evolutionary journey of a wonderful woman . in fact i think her book the treehouse : eccentric wisdom from my father on how to live , love , and see about her father leonard who was a professor at san francisco state may well be a great eye opener for those who want to read this book .

> jonathan safran foer 's new book , eating animals , presents a conversational approach to a topic in which we engage daily : eating . when his wife was pregnant with their first child , foer decided to pay closer attention to food , having made eclectic food choices until that time , from vegetarian to omnivore . trying to be a good parent , he wanted to make informed , thoughtful choices about food for his child . he spent 18 months visiting farms around the country , and the book gives ample space for farmers to describe how they do what they do , on our behalf and in response to what we desire . there are pages in eating animals that will take away your appetite , especially those that describe the practices of factory farming . as described in this book , factory farming is hard to defend . but foer 's writing style makes reading eating animals easy to swallow , but here 's a warning : you may change what you eat after reading this book . eating is cultural : we gather at table and tell our stories . our favorite foods are often tied to our closest relationships . foer makes that point strongly : food is culture , habit and identity . the lingering question is : should we change habits , especially when it comes to eating animals that come from factory farms ? read eating animals , and consider the question for you and your family.rating : four-star ( highly recommended )

> mitch rapp embodies everything an american would want in a government employee dedicated to fighting terrorism . he is intelligent , a skilled assassin , a caring husband and a guy who does n't care about rules or laws when the nation 's security is involved . mitch rapp is a super-hero , pure and simple.word reaches the top-secret orion group that terrorists are smuggling a nuclear weapon into the united states , most likely in order to devestate washington d.c. on memorial day . the story becomes far more complex and flynn is a master at creating an edge-of-your-seat tension.flynn 's plots are rich , his characters deeply drawn . you ca n't help but hate the bad guys and root for the good guys . the action is non-stop . mitch rapp , intelligent and philosophical as he is , does n't think twice about killing or incapacitating the enemies of the nation . and he is n't a nice guy when he is interrogating a suspect . no wishy-washy miranda warnings for mitch rapp . no lawyer 's conference 's about what is permitted . rapp goes for the jugular : literally when needed.flynn appears to be an unabashed american patriot - and his creation , mitch rapp , bears this out in page after page of solid action . it 's difficult to read the last page of mitch rapp novel without hoping that ficitional characters like him have their real-life equivalents . the nation and the world needs them.jerry

> many critics consider this to be jerry lewis ' best film . not being a big lewis fan , i ca n't comment on that , but it offers - at least in this day-and-age - a number of good and bad features.the good- this has a much nicer tone to it than the re-make , of course , ( restrictions back then when this was released ) . the speech at the end of the movie by the professor ( lewis ) was outstanding : touching with some profound statements . some earlier comic bits were funny , beginning with lewis in the dean 's office . perhaps the best humor was simply provided by lewis making faces when he played the nerdy science prof. his other character is not appealing , but it 's not supposed to be . however , i got tired a seeing a cigarette dangling out of his mouth . ( this was supposed to be a takeoff on dean martin ) . stella stevens was a pretty woman , except for the excessive eye makeup that was the style of the '60s . some of the dated expressions in here were funny to hear.the bad - a number of lewis ' bits were not that humorous and his singing was atrocious . why almost all entertainers - comedians , actors , etc - back then thought they were also good singers , is beyond me . you can just fast-forward through jerry 's songs .

> the giving quilt by jennifer chilvalliquiltsgiving get together annually for a winter session of camp to provide quilts to children in need , project linus.sylvia is the owner of the manor and she has many tasks to complete before the guests arrive for camp.the twins live there along with their mother who helps run the place.love how the membership will be gathering the fabrics to distribute to those who will be sewing . they will camp in rooms at the manor and meet to not only talk but give each other tips and the room comes with home made meals and food is grown on the estate.opening day , after a meal , everybody introduces themselves and tells why they are there to quilt and what charity means to them.other activities are scheduled : historical quilts from the estate are discussed . there are chapters of those attending and how they interact with the others.loved all the stories and especially the quilting instructions.hated hearing of the fabric and how it 's stolen from a shop that does n't have a store.i received this book from national library service for my bard ( braille audio reading device ) .

> lexar makes some of the best flash memory on this planet . i 've owned compactflash and secure digital cards from lexar , sandisk as well as generics from compusa . by far lexar 's offerings are the most reliable , giving me 100 % error-free performance . lexar cards also appear to be faster and more power-efficient , although i have n't done any rigorous testing , just experience . ( compusa 's are the worst -- i actually lost data on their 128mb cf card ! ) i 'm a pocket pc freak and i load my flash memory with tons of multimedia content , so reliability and speed are important to me.in the past lexar cards were a bit pricier than some other brands , but recently lexar has become very competitive and many of their products are actually among the cheapest . great quality + great value = totally recommended.note : you should still always back up your data regularly . on the pocket pc , use the back-up function in activesync . on any device , just copy the entire content of the card to a folder in your windows explorer .

> this device , once i figured out how to properly install it , is exactly what i needed . i can hear the tv dialogue ! i do n't need to be in front of the tv to do so and , in fact , can walk from the basement tv area to the second floor and still hear clearly . the device is easy to use and extremely easy to charge.if i had a complaint , it is that the on/off switch is too small for easily manipulation -- i 'm older , as i suspect are a substantial number of users -- as is the volume knob . moreover , it would aid if the volume knob and frequency tuning knob were easily distinguishable to the touch . yes , i know that the volume is on top and the tuner is on bottom , but bigger knobs with distinctively different feel would be an improvement .

> kidnapping movies have pretty much been done to death . so if you want a hook you better make it good . sorry to say this one is close but does n't quite make it . great acting from bacon , theron , and fanning carry it . the four succesful kidnaps and the need for medication by the fifth was a nice add but not enough . parts of the movie were quite exciting . turning off the plane engine so the kidnapper would n't know where they were was a nice touch . all-in-all a very watchable movie but not quite blockbuster material . i still recommend seeing it and you may find it enjoyable enough to purchase . a decent thriller movie for adults .

> i had requested these for my wife who loves popcorn . she was somewhat skeptical at first because of the small bag size of the snackwell compared to the much larger size of a regular bag of popcorn . she was watching a movie when i handed her the snackwell . after she tried the contents of one of the bags she declared her assessment of the product to be `` excellent '' . my only concern is that if she becomes addicted to this version of popcorn i would have to sell my pickup truck to pay for this stuff . maybe sell the dog as well .

> to be honest , i was hoping for a little more out of this book as it was the end of the series . this was kind of fun to read ad the dialogue was at times a pleasure , especially between the two main characters , but it just did n't have the substance and spark that i was hoping for . this was a book that i read quickly and will soon forget . it was n't terrible and is worth reading if you have read the rest of this series , but it was n't shocking or amazing . it was just ... okay .

> except for flashbacks , this consists mostly of an awkward conversation between the titular nymphomaniac ( joe ) and a somewhat nerdy good samaritan ( seligman ) . he finds her , badly beaten and tries to call for help . joe refuses an ambulance or police , but lets him take her to his small apartment . there , for some reason , she decides to unburden herself , almost a secular confessional into seligman 's attentive ear . clearly , the desperate and meaningless drive from one man to another lies wholly outside his world , but he tries to bridge the gap using analogies he can understand - fishing . not close analogies , maybe , but they 're all he has to work with.joe 's narration covers the whole of her sexual life - from pre-pubescent games , to dares between newly nubile teen friends , to the continuously increasing ( and increasingly risky ) demands her addiction places on her adult life , with each vignette brought to life on screen . gainsbourg 's lovely physical presence adds a grace and charm to each encounter that contrasts sharply to the rawness of the demons driving her . that rawness blunts what could have been eroticism , make those scenes look more and more like some kind of almost-unwilling sacrifice to some dark power , something that transforms all the questions of adult emotional life into something with only one answer - appropriate to the moment or not.this sets the arc of joe 's life in motion , and makes it easy to foresee how events of her past could have led to where we first saw joe , bleeding and beaten . part 2 , not yet in theaters at this writing , will surely connect those dots . i do n't anticipate a return of uma thurman , in her role as emotional wreckage after joe collided with her marriage , but she certainly created a scene to remember. -- wiredweird , reviewing the release to theaters

> soylent green . how many times have you heard those two words and either wondered what they meant or were amused that you knew what the words mean ? soylent green is a word from the movie soylent green.the movie stars charlton heston as thorn , a cynical cop in the first part of the 21st century . the human population has exploded so much ( over 40,000,000 living in nyc alone ) that people literally live on stairs and food is no longer grown in the wild , but genetically produced in factory-like laboratories . illiteracy is encouraged ( only a few can actually read & write ) , many women live their lives as legal slaves called `` furniture '' , mass riots are dispersed by using giant human scoops , the state sponsors giant suicide facilities called `` home '' , and soylent green is the best thing since sliced bread ( literally ) . thorn begins an investigation of a mysterious murder of a wealthy new yorker . he is assisted in his investigation by the aged sol ( edward g. robinson ) , a reader who remembers when flowers blossomed and supermarkets overflowed with food . what begins as a simple murder investigation , soon turns into a cover up with ties leading all the way the governor and the massive soylent corporation ( they produce half of the world 's food supply ) . thorn eventually makes a discovery that is even more chilling than upton sinclair 's the jungle.soylent green is n't a great movie . it moves rather slow and there is n't any continuos action until the movie 's last fifteen minutes . however , heston and robinson are both great in their roles . also , the movie made a deep impact upon the culture of our society and is watching at least once for that reason alone .

> this is the story of frank 's journey from impoverished immigrant teacher . he arrives in new york city at age 19 , accompanied by a priest he met on the boat . the priest gets frank a job at the biltmore hotel cleaning the lobby ; unfortunately , he also tries to take sexual advantage of frank . frank gets drafted and is sent to germany to train guard dogs ; then just when he is succeeding and getting along well with his dog , frank is sent to type reports . returning to the u.s. in 1953 he works on the docks , then a few office jobs , back to the docs , and finally talks his way into nyu after realizing his main interest is in literature . ( frank never attended high school , was put on probation . ) there he meets his ( first ) wife , studies while working ( also has g.i . bill ) , and bootstraps himself from unawareness of numerous big words.finishing his degree in 1957 , its off to find a job - hindered at first by his irish brogue . a daughter is born , though its obvious his marriage is not on the most solid ground . frank returns to ireland and his parents several times during the book , and they come to america to visit as well . frank 's brothers also join him in america . `` tis '' ends with the deaths of frank 's parents and his return for his father 's funeral , taking his daughter with.throughout this and all mccourt 's books the underlying dislike of protestants vs. catholics simmers , as well as the unhappy relationship between his mother and generally drunk father . tragic relationships , with good outcomes .

> this is perhaps a 5-star movie , but the over intensity prevented me `` loving '' this movie to a simply `` liking '' this movie . an experiment in the human psyche is conducted using a prison setting where one third of the participants are guards and two thirds are inmates . they are divided up according to their interview , part of which we get to see as a way to quickly build character . adrien brody is a prisoner . he is the ultra liberal atheists . forrest whitaker , a religious fellow who believes in absolute right and wrong becomes one of the guards . the two briefly talk and connect prior to the interview process.the participants are promised a $ 1,000 dollars a day as long as they follow the rules . breaking the rules must be dealt with `` commensurately '' and within 30 minutes or else the red light comes on , the experiment is over and no one gets paid . at this point i suspected two things : 1 ) the red light would never come on no matter what they did and 2 ) there were some shills within the group . i was wrong about the second one.while one of the rules was `` no violence '' the guards gradually test what constitutes violence . the red light becomes their `` god '' who `` approves '' of their action by inactivity . forrest whitaker eventually becomes the leader of the guards , even punishing his own guards who have compassion toward the prisoners . adrien brody becomes his rival as the leader of the prisoners.the acting is good . the action is at a good pace . there is human torture and beating as one might expect .

> this young debut author is destined for great things as his first novel so beautifully and achingly illustrates . being familiar with the russian and chechnya history and conflict made it easier to get into this novel but it 's the author 's lyrical and evocative prose that draws the reader into a largely unfamiliar world ravaged by years of conflict and at heart , a story of the human will to persevere and survive in the most terrible of circumstances . it brought to mind some of the heartbreaking accounts i 've read in holocaust-themed novels , that amidst the worst situations , there is always hope.the setting is chechnya , a federal subject of russia that has been engaged in conflict with russia , fighting for its independence . the timeline spans the years 1994 through 2004 and the effects of these rebellions is explored credibly in this searing account , focusing on the impact upon the populace of a hamlet . several characters serve as focal points - havaa , an eight-year-old girl whose father has been taken away due to an informant and akhmed , the incompetent doctor who saves her and hides her in an all but empty hospital . and there 's the lone surgeon sonja who is desperate to find her sister natasha . as i read , i discovered the motivations of some of these characters , including the informer ramzan , and as depressing as some parts were , there was also a sense of hope which alleviates the darkness . a recommended read .
= heartbreakingly beautiful

> first , i must say , i 'm a little perturbed by all the `` snobbery '' i see in some of these reviews . who give a flying sh*t-bird how many times the author used certain words or phrases ? it all smacks of pretentious author snobbery , when in reality the only opinion that matters is the individual reader at the time of reading.besides , a book can be eloquently written , but boring as hell . and the opposite can , and most certainly , is true . i read a good deal , and i was n't off-put by the authors word choice or euphemisms . why ? because this series sucked me into the lives of the characters . *grammar alone could never do that . *okay , rant over . here 's what i posted on my site about this 1st book : steamy , romantic , explores the depths of trust in intimate relationships.of the three books in the series , i found this one to be the most risque ' , mainly because the author had the cajones to put a few things in print that i 've never seen before . i applaud her courage , and think that the taboos covered in this book were well done ( that is , with honesty and without bias ) and made the book feel more like a literary journey into the private lives of real people -- and less like the `` chic porn '' that some critics claim .

> if you like crime writing , you 've surely read some titles by robert crais . if you 're lucky , you 've read a few of his stories featuring elvis cole , a likable , laconic private detective . cole is tough but totally accessible as readers sympathize with the man who does not know his father and knows too well that his mother was mentally deficient.cole 's is also a man who knows all too well that when the phone rings before sunrise it can only mean trouble . he 's right . an lapd officer calls to ask him to come down and identify a body . when cole persists in asking why they 're calling him , he 's told that before the man died he said he was cole 's father . apparently homeless the man had been found shot in an alley.voice performer jack daniels captures cole 's strengths and vulnerability as cole tries to unearth the past and discover the dead man 's identity . was he cole 's father ? at times , searches reveal what we do n't want to discover . that 's precisely what happens to cole . someone who knew the dead man believes cole is searching for him . this person does not want to be found , and will kill to make sure he isn't.listeners will thoroughly enjoy following a path of clues with cole , his buddy joe pike , and lapd detective carol starkey.- gail cooke

> really glad the developer listened to their market and developed the single player ai mode . while that other game where you can play words with your friends is popular for its reasons , it lacks the single player option for those word enthusiasts that just need to geek out with letters ! . for the scrabble traditionalist this game does not disappoint , it has all the bells and whistles that it requires to both play single player as well as online . the only options i would love to see are : 1. have the ability to turn off the animations ( currently you can skip them when they start , but if you could turn them off the game could be played a bit faster . 2. the dictionary allows the player to validate a word , but not see its definition . the computer ai often plays words that even as experienced as i may be , still end up looking up for curiosity ( which takes me out of the app to my dicionary and back again - a journey that is too long most of the time ) . overall great job ea games ! very solid 5 star endorsement .

> when i first read the description fr this book , i thought it just might be the kind of book i would want to steer clear of . i tend to avoid the more controversial titles as i usually find them to be and utter disappointment and waste of time . instead , what i found upon reading this book , was that it was very well written , funny and ultimately the exact opposite of the boring text i had prepared myself for . this book is written in a way that is both inspiring and comical . i laughed frequently , but could also see the deeper meaning in this book . after reading this , i went to bed , contemplating the things this author had spoken of in his work . i like it when a book makes you evaluate things in your life . i would most definitely recommend this book to any spiritual leader or anyone looking for a good read . i wish that more people in organized religion took the time to care about what their followers think and how best to reach them on a purely human level .

> i took a chance on this album based on the international hit single contained therein , i want to know what love is , which became a number one hit in britain and elsewhere . i love the ballads but i 'm so not keen on the rocking songs , because lou gramm seems to be shouting rather than singing.the set opens with one of the rocking songs ( tooth and nail ) then continues with two superb love ballads ( that was yesterday , i want to know what love is ) that were both released as singles . next comes another excellent ballad ( growing up the hard way ) , though as the title suggests , it is not a love song but describes life 's struggles . two rocking songs ( reaction to action , stranger in my house ) precede more great ballads ( love in vain , down on love , two different worlds ) . the album closes with another rocking song ( she 's too tough ) , but this one works much better for my ears than the other rockers here.foreigner liked to consider themselves as a hard-rock group , but while they could certainly rock with the best , i quickly realized why their biggest hits were all ballads . lou gramm is a fine ballad singer but he struggles with the up-tempo songs . fans of hard-rock music tend to be more interested in the music rather than the singing , and some of them despise ballads.on reflection , i wonder how many people will truly love every track here , but although i 'm not one of them , i enjoyed enough of the album to make me glad i bought it .
= at their commercial peak but not exactly my kind of music
< lou gramm is a great album

> the lord of the rings trilogy was just straight and flat out boring . i hated those books so much that i could n't describe . the hobbit , however , is ten times better and actually has some good stuff and action scenes to it . the whole thing is interesting , since the plot is very unique , and also the characters are richly and warmly developed . this is the stuff that good fantasy is made out of , and i do n't know why tolkien changed his writing skills when he wrote lord of the rings . anyways , this book rocks . it 's a great book to read next to the fireplace on a rainy night inside your home , and the paintings which are held inside this book , ( in other words what tolkien describes and how he describes it ) is simply and positively extraordinary and different from all other books that i have read , and i 've read lots of books . anyways , get this book . at first , it did n't really seem interesting . but a lot of great books do n't immediatly start out interesting . but after the slow parts , it 's like a rollar coaster . the lord of the rings , however , was slow all the way through . i 'm surprised that people even manage to read all three installments.anyways , this book is great . many other authors have copied tolkien and just came out with pale imitations . this is the original fantasy book which started the entire genre of good fantasy epic novels . read this book . it 's excellent .
= better than lord of the rings .

> this director 's cut dvd is one of those films that says , `` it did n't happen as you were told . now i 'm going to show you the truth . '' the film 's view is that the legends of king arthur are based on a real man who did not live during the middle ages , as the legends state , but in the middle of the fifth century ; also he was n't an englishman , but a roman . the film tells us that around 450 , when rome was in decline , and england , which the romans had conquered was being overrun by saxons , the romans kidnapped youngsters and forced them to serve in their army for fifteen years . one of these youngsters was arthurius , known to us as arthur . arthur became quite adept at fighting and led a small group of about a half dozen men , including lancelot and tristan , who were devoted to him and whom he called his knights . as a final fight before releasing the band at the conclusion of their fifteen years , the romans insisted that he fight against the saxons . arthur has no choice but to agree , and his band joins him . they encounter a group of english led by a man called merlin , and his soldier genevieve , and need to decide if they will work with merlin 's army . the film is filled with battle scenes . viewers who enjoy such scenes will , like this film .
= plenty of battle scenes for a roman arthur

> after nearly losing it in the operating room due to lack of sleep , surgeon luke finds himself on the doorstep of his nemesis sister in law , janica , who is on the verge of a canceling a threesome . luke tosses out the other two guys so that he can finally take janica this one time ... when the hospital sends him on a forced vacation for four weeks to big sur , janica finds him and is determined to turn their single night of pent up lust turn into a relationship . can luke give in and share his life with someone else ? what a huge disappointment . it 's predecessor , take mewas a steamy and well developed story that dove into the relationship of the protagonists ( janica 's sister and lukes twin brother ) , `` love me '' has nearly as many pages , but it you account for the enormous margins and large print , it is easily half the size , which means character development and plot take a back seat the many couplings of the couple . it reads more like a short story that would be included in an anthology rather than a stand alone trade paperback . i love a steamy romance , but also like a side of plot . if you take out those passages , there are about 30 pages of sappy dialogue and introspection . overall a disappointing sequel all around .
= underdeveloped sequel

> the riveting true account of a mentally disturbed person 's dream turned into an unconstituionally taken and used confession after five years after the crime and after his solid alibi 's unvideotaped witness was dead ( his mother ) is landslided and sent to death row by an overzealous small town justice system in oklahoma.the exoneration by dna and indigent appeals attorneys is heartwarming , yet the small town justice system never really let go , even when there was substantial evidence to a possible real killer staring them in the face.this is scary for all americans . it could and does happen in our country . too many citizens and not just in bible belt have wrong concept from outset ( as this read illustrates ) that one is presumed guilty until proven innocent . i experienced firsthand evidence of this in oj 's trial on talking with people . they could and would not separate the allowable evidence in the courtroom versus what their gut told them about the innocence or guilt of the defendant . makes me scared to ponder their inclusion on jury duty with this attitude and presuppositions.highlights corrections system problems as well as contentions over morality of death penalty.grisham has demonstrated remarkable author range from football to christmas to legal fiction to now great legal non-fiction.important and gripping read !

> first of all , i did not read the book so i 'm not reviewing it from the perspective of the book.i love a good courtroom drama . one thing i liked about this movie was that it showed the courtroom from the perspectives of the jurors , even though not from a `` ten angry men '' type of way.the story is fantastic . it is nice to have a good movie with a decent plot ( hollywood , take notice ! ! ! ) . there just are n't enough of these . the acting is wonderful with this all star cast . the characters are very real and believable . cusack and weisz are perfect in their roles . hackman nails his part perfectly as the cold-hearted goffer for the gun-manufacturers . hoffman also does a magnificent job by playing the exact opposite as hackman 's role . i 've always loved cusack as he always plays the ultimate nice guy type of role . he nails his part quite wonderfully . everybody did a great job , i really enjoyed the acting.i would recommend this film without question . i really enjoyed watching it . however , many may not agree with the verdict of the trial ...

> ian fleming 's novel , `` chitty chitty bang bang , '' is a far cry from his james bond novels . in this novel for younger readers , the story is about a british family who buy a magical car with a mind of it 's own . the pott family includes their father inventor , mimsy , and fraternal twins jeremy and jemima . once they get in the car which they nicknamed chitty chitty bang bang , they are off for an adventure of a lifetime . they face danger too.still the novel is updated with illustrations by joe berger in black and white . the novel has a light-hearted easy appeal to young readers who might enjoy the novel . apart from the easiness of plot and writing , it 's an enjoyable read for adults as well.if there is a downside , it 's not suspenseful enough but predictable at times . it 's still a light-hearted read and enjoyable as well . i highly recommend it for younger readers . it 's decent escapism for the toughest of days .

> i have never liked rabbit ear antennas from a looks standpoint , but the reviews on most of the other flat antennas were mixed . then i ran across this one from mohu . the reviews seemed good from most so i got two of them . i played with the placement a little last night and this antenna rocks ! i had bought an inexpensive rabbit ear one from rca and it works ok , but this antenna picked up 17 channels where the rca only got 9 ! the olympic games were questionable at best on the rca one , but are crystal clear on this one unless i walk right in front of the antenna . i have not mounted the second one yet , but was very happy with the first one . love the ability to have black or white so you can change it to go with your room the best . i am trying to cut cable and this has helped for sure with the reception it gets .

> this is a perfectly adequate product that does exactly what it 's manufacturer claims to be able to do.it fits my older model iphone with its fosmon rubberized hard skin and has a perfect slot on the bottom for the chargers male end.it was easy to put up . i stuck it to first my inexpensive ( very , very inexpensive ) wooden book case that sits next to my desk . i wanted to try it here first before i put it in my kitchen on one of the cabinets . the kitchen is where i keep my iphone when its charging . the station was easy to remove and it left no stain or scratches on this cheap cabinet after two week of use.it is nice to have a specific place in which to keep my phone , i wo n't be hunting it down in hysteria when i need to throw it in my purse ever again !
= no need to hunt for iphone anymore

> this movie seems to have an identity crisis . one minute it 's a blood-and-guts , shoot-em-up violent movie and the next minute it tries to be funny and tongue-in-cheek . ben affleck is hard to believe as a newly-released convict who assumes his dead cellmate 's identity and the lady penpal who is waiting for his release . he wants only to go home , drink hot chocolate , and watch football games with his father , but alas , he becomes involved with some bad guys who think he really is the man he is impersonating . there is lots of shooting , beatings , and violence , but through it all , ben maintains his sense of humor . the only thing that saves this movie ( the actors are hindered by a bad script ) are the twists and turns of the plot at the end which keep it from being a 1-star attraction .
= violence -- with a twist

> to start off this review , if you have n't read the first novella in the series , indentured , i would recommend you read it prior to picking this one up : while this novella could stand on its own , it will make a lot more sense as book one plugs the background information.similar to the first in the series , this is a short and fun little novella . i will tell you i was a little disappointed there was n't a continuation of the characters from book one , but what you have here is a real continuation of the story in this case the ancestors of the original population of the planet hydra . it is pretty fast-paced and mcelhaney is a good storyteller . at 99 cents , this one is a bargain and i just purchased book 3 in the series to see where the adventure goes next .

> play him again ( a matt hudon novel ) seems to indicate another book might happen . i hope so . jeffrey m stone has done an out standing job in this first book , sort of a historic , crime drama . the book doe n't drag like some first books , over telling us about characters but we learn enough to want more ( a second book ) . hudson is an anti-hero being a booze runner to the well to do in prohibition la . nice name dropping and history on `` talkies '' thrown in for realism . recommendednote : i received a complimentary copy of this book for the purpose of review . all opinions are 100 % my own .

> mick jagger has had a long and illustrous career with the stones , and over the years he has released 3 proper solo albums and a bunch of one-off singles and songs . this collection tries to bring it all home , and at times manages to do that , but at other times fails . `` the very best of mick jagger '' ( 17 tracks , 72 min . ) starts off with an ok `` god gave me everything '' , one of the few decent songs of `` goddess in the doorway '' ( the worst album ever rated 5 ( ! ) stars by rolling stone magazine ) . jagger 's best solo album , `` she 's the boss '' is under-represented by only having a mere 2 songs on here : `` just another night '' ( his biggest solo hit ever , not counting the duet singles such as `` dancing in the streets '' ) , and `` lucky in love '' . what a mistake , how could `` goddess in the doorway '' have more songs on here ? besides the true and tried duet hits `` dancing in the streets '' ( with david bowie ) and `` ( you got ta walk and ) do n't look back '' ( with peter rosh ) , this compilation is worthwhile for a couple of other off-center tracks like the excellent `` memo from turner '' ( from the 1969 movie `` performance '' ) , and the 1973 unreleased track `` '' too many cooks ( spoil the soup ) '' . the other unreleased tracks `` charmed life '' and `` checking up on my baby '' are ok but non-essential.in all , this compilation is a fair representation of mick jagger 's solo work , if woefully underrepresented by `` she 's the boss '' but it simply confirms what we 've known all along : without his brethren in the rolling stones , jagger is not nearly as compelling .

> rathbone is the attorney for the defendant in the title case , but as is often the case in mysteries ; things are not quite what they seem . thus he requires the investigatory powers of monk to help him find the true heart of the matter . hester is involved in a nursing matter of her own dealing with a soldier who is horrifically injured and the difficulty he and his wife are having dealing with this condition . but the matter she is dealing with leads to a mystery as well and monk once again becomes embroiled in a matter which seems to lead to no easy solution.this is my first anne perry book and i was impressed by her ability to handle characters . they are well-drawn and convey real emotion towards each other in the way that characters in all excellent series do . the mysteries involved , while not entirely original are well-structured and although the central mystery takes far too long to be revealed the author generally plays fairly with the readers . i was a little surprised by the rather modern sensibilities that many of characters take towards victorian morality , it seems odd that all the characters with these beliefs are portrayed sympathetically and all others are without any redeeming qualities , but this is a central point in this book . perhaps this was not the best choice to start reading the `` william monk '' series , but i was intrigued enough to give the series another shot .

> defending jacob : a noveli am an avid reader having read 100 's of books maybe thousands throughout my lifetime . i read this on my kindle and could not stop reading it till i was finished . it took me a little more then a day to read and it was time very well spent . this is one of the best novels i have read in quite a while . the author grabs you from the first page and does not let you go until the last page . the book is so well written that if i did n't know better i would think that it was a true story . i could see this book being based upon a conglomoration of several true stories that have made it to the media . landay obviously knows his way around the court system and the district attorneys office . never boring , engrossing to the point that i had to finish it in one fell swoop to see what the outcome was . excellent ending , nothing i would have imagined . if i could give this novel more then 5 stars i would . if you are into non boring court room novels you will not be disappointed when you pick this one up . i can not recommend this enough to those readers who enjoy court room novels that are excellently written , superbly thought out with a fantastic ending that will not let you down .

> excavation is one of those books that you enjoy reading it , but afterwards , you ask yourself , & quot ; did i really like it ? & quot ; rollins ' novel is basically a comic book story , reminiscent of the old cliffhanger serials of the thirties and forties . i found one of my main problems with this book is that it seems incredibly slow , even when there is action going on . i guess it 's because the perils of the trapped students at the excavation site are predictable and it seems to take forever to resolve them . i thought & quot ; if there 's one more attack by these & quot ; pale creatures , & quot ; i was going to lose it ! the characterizations are as stereotypical as you can get , and the villains are predictably nasty.a nice element of the story , however , is the relationship between professor henry and dr. joan . their & quot ; twilight & quot ; romance is refreshing and touching . sam 's relationship or lack thereof with maggie is not as effective . the elimination of one of the focal characters midways through the book is also disappointing , but not surprising.all in all , excavation is not a bad read ; it 's just not that original or exciting .

> at first i was reluctant to read it . it sounded depressing - an alien species invading earth and taking possession of human bodies . the aliens were winning . however , the story unfolded differently from what i expected . it 's a story of love developing among people ( and others ) who are different . it 's a story of someone finding bravery within themselves to save the lives of and to help those they love . it shows relationships within a community and how different humans are from each other . it provides feelings of hope , warmth and fulfillment.this book has been labeled as an adult novel . however , based on what my teenagers have been assigned to read in school , i think the host would be appropriate for teens.sexual language : none . number of sex scenes : none . setting unknown time , probably in the near future , in chicago , san diego and arizona desert . copyright : 2008. genre : romantic science fiction and human relationships fiction.for a list of my reviews of other stephenie meyer books , see my 5 star review of `` twilight '' posted 3/10/07 .

> this movie has a good plot but that 's where it ends , this type of movie where one is in a different place ... .then ... .etc.. ( i am not going to spoil a spoiled movie ) i do like the fact that they show what the little girl did was wrong . ( euthanasia is wrong ) . other than that , the hospital is never explained , are they a cult ? vampires ? both ? not enough scares , there is a part where the nurses get naked and drink blood . ( that 's the highlight of the movie , except the blood )

> & quot ; blind eye & quot ; haunted me for quite awhile after i read it . the book portrays a classic example of evil being assisted by bureaucratic ineptitude . stewart makes his case that dr. michael swango may be the most prolific serial killer in u.s. history . his case is a compelling page turner that reads like fiction . even scarier is that swango is due to be released this year . one caution , do not read this book if you are planning to be in the hospital any time soon . you will not find it comforting .

> after major surgery and a new life of exercise , i would walk and count steps ( because i read that 2000 steps is one mile and i wanted to chart my progress ) . after awhile trying to count steps all the time can be distracting ( especially if you are walking with someone and ca n't carry on a conversation and count steps simultaneously ! haha ) . so i purchased this pedometer - did not count even 1/4 of my steps ! sent it back .

> in terms of value , this famous 1982 live performance of the mahler ninth is no bargain compared to the studio version karajan made just two years previously . not only is the studio version part of a bargain two-fer , but it includes as filler some excellent mid-seventies performances of mahler songs with the wonderful christa ludwig.critics have gravitated to this live ninth , despite its high price , as the better of the two , although the gramophone awarded both the same prize when they came out . so the amazon reviewer 's comment that the studio version was `` so-so '' is ridiculous -- the gramophone itself declares that it is difficult to pick between the two . karajan did n't change his basic tempos ( mostly quite broad ) or his somewhat detached apollonian view of the score -- detached , that is , compared to the totally involving and emotionally untempered bernstein , also with berlin , from 1979. what other orchestra can claim to have made three great mahler ninths in the space of three years ! what bernstein misses that karajan abundantly supplies is astonishing clarity , virtuosic orchestral playing that stands above any other version on cd , and a total command of line and balance . those qualities count for a lot , and they are present in both sets . i do think , listening to them side by side , that karajan got more of everything from the berlin phil . under live concert conditions -- the whole thing feels more spontaneous , spacious , and alert on the musicians ' part . but here we are comparing two superlative accounts . in terms of recorded sound , the digital 1982 , as remastered here , is excellent in every way , while the earlier analog recording is a bit studio bound with less air and space around the individual instruments.all in all , these readings are so stupendous in their musicality and virtuosity that it 's worth buying them both .

< a bargain two-fer , but the mahler ninth is better

> if the author , betty medsger , does n't receive the pulitzer prize for non-fiction or the national book award , then there is something wrong with them . the book is a shocking expos & eacute ; of j edgar hoover 's federal bureau of investigation and how it was uncovered by an actual burglary of an fbi office in media , pennsylvania.on march 8 , 1971 , anti war activists burglarized an fbi office while the world watched the legendary ali-frazier boxing match at madison square garden in new york city . the burglars were brazen and highly intelligent enough to select that night in particular.in return of stealing all the files , they uncovered the fbi 's shocking secrets about their leader and bureau 's illegal practices . i already read curt gentry 's scathing biography of hoover . i can tell you that it was difficult to read anymore than a 100 pages at a time because the revelations and a use of power was disturbing . this book is n't just about hoover but about his bureau 's illegal , immoral , unethical and just evil policies.if you have n't lost respect for j. edgar hoover by now , you will by reading this book . he was truly a puppet master behind influencing watergate and mccarthyism . president nixon , senator mccarthy , and others were the scapegoat but hoover was truly responsible . hoover who even mistreated clyde tolson , his best friend.hoover was a narcissistic sociopath who ruined the lives and drove ernest hemingway and actress , jean seberg , to suicide . there are more revelations too shocking to reveal.once you realize hoover 's almost dictatorial leadership in his bureau , you will see the crimes committed in his name . the bureau building 's name in washington d.c. should be changed in memory and honors of the countless victims under hoover.i can assure this book is an eye opening read in understanding a dark chapter in american history .

> my wife grew up onsmall wonder : the complete first season ( there was n't much else on tv in burma ) and loved it . i on the other hand only saw it for the first time this month ( over 2 decades later ) . i was struck by how much i liked the show . in a way , it 's like a mix offull houseandisaac asimov . for the most part , it 's a family sit-com with some of the usual dilemmas ( son running away from home , annoying neighbors , etc ) . however , classic sci-fi themes about the boundary between robots and humanity arise frequently , giving the show a bit more intellectual juice . i also like the fact that the dad is a computer geek . in fact , he sometimes sounds like a character straight out of asimov.unfortunately , small wonderdoes suffer from its low budget . it is n't , as some allege , one of the worst sit-coms of all time . in fact , i think in a lot of ways , it was ahead of its time . but the acting and production quality are all very much low budget , making it seem antiquated today . the corny `` small wonder '' theme song does n't help . i 'm not sure we 'll ever see a revival in small wonder . it 's shame , because the show really has a lot of potential and , as far as i can remember , is the first ( and only ? ) sci-fi sit-com .

> i actually chose this book for its title `` gossip '' after having watched people destroy one another ( and even things they cared about ) by gossip . in fact , i actually had one woman ask me if it was `` really '' gossip if it was true . ( yes ) .gossip is knowing negative things about another individual - and telling others what you know . whether the individual told you in confidence , or whether you are simply someone who has them from another source , when you repeat it , it is gossip ! this particular story tells how gossip can destroy individuals and even families . it focuses on our right to have things that are private , that others simply do n't need to know ! and even if you feel they `` should '' know - tough , as the bearer of the information , you are multiplying the problem , not helping anyone.the good - good characterization.the bad - story intertwines and is slow at times.kind of average for me ... three stars .

> i had never seen this movie until this past october , and that was only a portion . still , i must say i was intrigued enough to order the dvd . and then i thought , hey , i 'll go for the director 's cut . so i really have nothing to compare that to , but let 's just that i truly enjoyed it.i understand that the movie is something of a cult classic and it is easy to see why . i hate to call it pure horror as it is much funnier and sweeter than that , but it does have the stuff of such . in truth , it is a movie about ghosts rather than a scary movie and the tortured man who works a con operation with them.i 'm a huge fan of michael j. fox and i think he does pretty good in this . his character is a little more sensitive than what i have seen him and he pulls it off , but he most comes to life as the stalwart and brave soul we all know he is.the tale itself is really quite imaginative , especially those fascinated by the fun ghosts can offer . in fact , most of the ghosts we meet are nice and funny rather than scary . and hey , someone was actually to make ghosts work with objects in a logical way ! this is a great halloween movie and if this had extra scenes i liked them . the extras are also plenty of fun , featuring the making of , interviews , and even a bit on real ghostly experiences .

> i have been reading kathy reichs since she wrote her first book , and i have come to expect good writing with excellent forensic information . this book does not disappoint . having said that , this book does not have the tension that a lot of her previous books do . the book is set in quebec , canada this time , and we get to see a really unique part of canada - the acadian area in new brunswick , as well . i do enjoy how ms. reichs spotlights her native country . readers can tell that there is a real love for canada that comes out loud and clear in her writing . this book was also a little different . tempe comes into this story on a mission to find a vanished old girlhood friend . as she investigates she thinks that she finds links to this old friend in some more recent missing person cases , and in bodies of young girls that turn up in her lab . how she goes about connecting the dots is a little bit far-fetched , but still the hunt is fun and ms. reichs is a great storyteller . i will continue to look forward to her next book .

> i quite enjoyed this instalment of the coretti dynasty series , written by several authors . the h is a reformed wild child actress and the h is an unrepentant player . they meet at the infamous wedding that sparked the series , uncovering the correttis ( sicily 's corretti dynasty ) , gives the background . the h is trying to avoid scandal at all cost so that she can complete her new movie . the h kisses her at the wedding and a vindictive fling of his leaks the story to the press . the h is then left to face the music by herself and she comes up with the story that she and the h are engaged . when she goes to confront him , he says he 's going to announce that she made the whole thing up . however he soon sees that he gets business credibility so he decides to go along with the ruse . neither of these two want a relationship or commitment and i liked that the h was n't the pathetic one in the relationship . it was a good story for these two with their difficult pasts .

> when a troubled teenager is pushed over the edge by cyber-bullies , he plots a violent revenge for which he plants roadside crosses throughout the monterey peninsula , a situation for which body-language expert kathryn dance and monterey county sheriff 's senior deputy michael o'neil race against the clock to stop the youth from acting on his rage.but nothing is as it seems in this latest thriller from jeffery deaver . this thriller was full of surprises . it impresses upon you the fact that certain blogs can get out of hand with irrational truths . it also brings to light the problems of cyber-bullying , which is all too real.overall though , i found this to be just an average thriller . other than some surprises it did n't have the 'bang ' i come to expect . `` there are laws to protect the freedom of the press 's speech , but none that are worth anything to protect the people from the press .

> for the money , i must say that these cables are top-notch , and have exceeded my expectations ! i bought three of these for our basement [ wall-mounted flat screen ] tv setup that includes : 1. a fios converter box ; 2. a 3d blu-ray player ; and 3. an xbox 360. all look much better on hdmi ( as expected ) than coax , s-video , or component video inputs . these are well-constructed , and will undoubtedly last a long time . the only issue you may encounter is that these have the heavy `` anti-crush '' grommets -- or whatever you call those cylindrical rubberized protection devices ( no , not those ! ... keep your mind out of the gutter ! ) on each end . if you are mounting your tv close to the wall , these may limit your routing capability . probably a non-issue for most who are considering these though !

> after finishing new moon ( the twilight saga , book 2 ) in 2007 for the first time , i was pretty excited that i did n't have long to wait for the third book to arrive in stores . i had been so excited to see where this series ( i had thought it was going to be just a trilogy ) would end , that by the time i reached the cryptic ending , i felt rather annoyed with the drawn out pacing . i am looking forward to seeing the series conclude , but sure was n't looking forward to waiting ! it 's an entertaining series , but the pacing here begins to slow down a bit , and the prospect of another year 's wait for the conclusion is disappointing . i am thoroughly hooked into the series now , but wish that i had waited to read it until the series was complete !
= an exciting , fluffy read !
< entertaining , but not great

> not as bad a shis lincoln book , bill once again assures us he can not write-without the assistance of dugard . where are his facts ? the lincoln library wo n't accept his previous work , so why would people accept this trash as historically accurate ? he does n't seem to want to acknowledge the conflicting reports but just goes along with the warren commision-duh . boring stuff here , folks . save your money and time and read the much better books out there on this subject . just cause he has a talk show to promote his wares , does not make a great author . be warned . yes , i was given this book as a gift-was pondering sending it to my conservative brother , but then again , why propagate sub standard journalism masquerading as truth ? into the trash can it goes .

> there is no better gift than an amazon gift card ! it does n't matter what the recipient is into , be it movies , music , books or clothes . amazon has all that and a lot more ! you ca n't beat the convenience of ordering the gift card online . it really is the perfect gift if you do n't know what to get someone or if you have been invited to something last minute and do n't want to show up empty handed . it takes only a couple of minutes to get the gift certificate . you have the convenience of either emailing it to the person or printing it and putting it in a card to present to them . when you give an amazon gift certificate , you are giving the person exactly what they want ! !

> powerful , moving and heart-warming drama that is based on a true story . hard-nosed school principal joe clark ( morgan freeman ) who also goes by 'crazy joe ' is asked by two school board members to try and shape up the under-achieving new jersey 's east side high . the student body is mostly made up of african-american and hispanic kids . many good scenes and rather good direction here , i thought . in the end , mr. clark winds up with the respect and devotion from at least most if not all the students as well the teachers . i guess the moral of this flick is that 'tough love ' really can pay off in a big way . if you liked the movie 'the principal ' , you should get a lot from this title . recommended .

> to some people , lyle lovett is that guy with the funny hair who used to be married to julia roberts . but his fans know that he 's a hell of a talented singer/songwriter . this was his second album . there were four singles released from the album . `` give back my heart '' reached # 13 on the country chart , `` she 's no lady '' reached # 17 , `` i loved you yesterday '' reached # 24 and `` if i had a boat '' reached # 66. lovett wrote all the songs on the album . many of the songs are quite witty . lovett is classified as a country artist , but several of the songs here have a jazzy feel to them . good album .

> i loved this kindle , but i have to advise anyone that purchases this product to get at least a 2yr warranty . i 'm an avid reader , sometimes reading three books a day , so the casual reader would benefit from this type of warranty . two years and two months after purchase of my wonderful reading device , it suddenly looked like an etch-a-sketch . yes , my screen completely crashed and it was less expensive to purchase a new one then to get it fixed . so be warned , this product is worth the price , but once it crashes your only course of action is buying a new one if you do n't have a warranty .
= get a 2yr warranty , though !

> sensa berry burst chews are little squares of very chewy , very flavorful fruity taffy . they have 1g of fiber plus 15 calories each . eating one or two with 8 oz . of liquid between meals is supposed to curb the appetite . it certainly does help , though no more so than any other chewy candy and a glass of water would.plain water works best as the liquid because they have so much flavor and it is absolutely necessary to drink it because they do tend to leave behind an unpleasant gritty fiber in the mouth and throat otherwise . the taste is also a bit artificial.sensa chews are also available in achocolate fudge flavorthat goes well with coffee .
= chewy fruity taffy

> you know , i really was unsure of this series . i mean come on , kentucky ? thick accents ? boy was i wrong . now i understand my friends obsession with this show . i have watched all but season 4 . if you are a person who has n't seen this series yet , do so asap.it 's got all the twists and turns of a good mystery , the back-stabbing two timing double dealing shenanigans you could possibly want and to top it all off , humor . i will give you fair warning , it is highly addictive .

> it 's easy to see why everyone loves this cartoon . i believe i speak for everyone when i say why the hell was this show canceled ? this show was addictive , if not for the weirdly enchanting music video segments , for the colorful and intriguing storylines . the show had a really long way to go had it not been canceled . i especially loved the way the characters were portrayed as if they were real people .

> great quick way to send someone a gift who mostly buys from amazon , such as myself . sometimes you just do n't know what to get certain people and this is a good way for them to get something that they really wanted instead of you guessing and having them go through the hassle of returning items . i also buy these for my daughter 's monthly allowance since she is always shopping on here anyways .

> `` dreams both real and strange '' by k.w . mccabe is supposed to be an anthology of short stories . a collection of stories . i do n't know about others , but when i think of the word anthology i think of a few stories at least 10,000 words or more . or when i think of a collection of short stories , i see a collection as being more than five . ok , i know you think i am nit-picking but had you spent your dollar on this `` anthology '' i think you would be disappointed that you spent your money on something that took about 15 minutes to read . yes , i know it is only a dollar but it is the principle.the first few `` short stories '' were only a few paragraphs that literally took me about 1 minute to read . these `` stories '' hinted at fantasy and a darker side . they were slightly confusing because it 's like the writer took a scene from the middle of a story and it left little to the imagination because readers are sure to be confused and wondering what , when and how . this `` anthology '' read more like a rough draft of an idea of a story that could potentially evolve into a real story . had the writer taken the time to really develop the idea it could have been something interesting to read . i did get a glimpse of the writer 's potential when i read the last one . it was considerably longer and left the reader wondering what would happen next . i really suggest the writer take time to craft his/her ideas because i think with some development this could be something so much more and worth spending money on .

> this is the first in gibson 's series on the seattle chinooks hockey team . georgie , a dyslexic beauty queen from texas flees her seattle wedding to a millionaire old enough to be her granddaddy , and hitches a ride with one of his prized hockey players , john `` the wall '' kowalsky . a one night stand whereby john dumps her at the airport with an airline ticket produces a precocious daughter named lexie.georgie has tried to move on with her life , she has a successful career as a caterer . seven years after their liaison , john runs into georgie at a fundraiser . when he stops at her house to return the checkbook she dropped , he discovers his love child and wants to play daddy , even if he has to sue for custody.despite her misgivings as well as the start of a new romance , georgie reluctantly invites john into their lives , and soon they are back in bed . when team owner virgil discovers lexie 's parentage , he issues john an ultimatum - georgie or the chinooks.there is also a great secondary romance between her sarcastic business partner , mae , and hockey goalie , hugh miner , who has met his match . i would have liked more of their romance , since it was so funny ( and she was so anti-jock ) .i loved the story ( even if it was pretty predictable ) , but found the constant `` cryin ' all night '' exclamations from georgie , and lexie 's constant use of the term `` gots '' ( cute the first 2 times ; annoying and redundant by the 30th utterance ) to grate on my nerves .

> this comes in a pretty simple package . a small plastic packet with the battery , 2 prying tools , and a tiny instruction . it took me just about 5 minutes to open the 5th gen ipod , remove old battery , and install the new one . i only needed one of the tools to pry it open . the best place to start is the top corner , twist the tip a little bit , then slide it down , and twist again , slide , until you can open it with your fingers like a clam shell . most of the time was spent is just for being slow and careful as the leads seams to be very delicate . the most important thing when installing the new one is to make sure that the contact lead is well inserted into the socket . i used a long nose pliers to push it , which at the same time making sure that i am not squeezing it too hard or bending it too much.the battery looks a tad slimmer . i charged the ipod for 4 hours . now , i am happy that my ipod is working again.pros : + fantastic value+ easy installation+ comes with 2 double ended toolscons : - less juice than original ipod batteryupdate : almost 4 months after , still satisfied with the battery . charge is not as long as the original ( which what i expect in the first place - probably 80 % as compared with the oem ) . still a fantastic value .

> i love almost everything about this cover . the first thing i did when i got it was to spray it with shoe protectant . on occasion , i 'm going to be holding it just after washing my hands , and i had be realistic about taking care of it . it 's been only a month , but the case still looks brand new.i have the purple one , and it 's gorgeous . a deep royal purple . the texture and pattern of the leather are nice and create interest . the stitching around the edges makes it even more attractive . the magnet closure is powerful enough to keep the cover closed when the device is jostled around inside my handbag . on the down side , the front cover seems a tad flimsy , but it 's held up so far.the best thing about the cover is that the kindle turns on when i open it , and turns off when i close it . i thought this feature would be no big deal , but it helps to simulate the expected reading experience . with a paperback book , you do n't have to turn it on or off ; you just open the cover . and now i can do that with my kindle . wonderful !
= beautiful and convenient
< love it !

> i wondered myself why someone did n't make a power adapter for a usb hook-up before , many times one is not near their pc or laptop to charge their devices . after further research and use this adapter does not power every usb related device , as i earlier thought . so far the only thing it can charge is the kindle . i thought it would charge other devices , mp3 's etc etc , but it will not.i tried different usb cables and none of them work with this adapter . so maybe we need to create an adapter that will do that very thing , and work with all usb devices . ( any inventors out there ? ) so amazon you should have made that fact a little more clear in the discription ( for kindle or kindle touch only ! ! ! ) so this is perfect for the kindle , but nothing else . just so you will not get confused or mislead , as i had thought ealier myself.so for the kindle i give it 3 stars and if it had the ability to charge other usb related devices this would be perfect , but it 's not ! ! !
= usb power adapter , for kindle

> in clapton 's own words the blues are `` a celebration of triumph over adversity '' , which certainly is the case here.there 's no doubt the clapton is a great musician , so i 'll leave who 's the best up to others to debate.i 've been familiar with mr. clapton 's music for years , but would n't call myself a die hard fan . someone lent me this book , so i read it.i took the trouble of listening to the music mentioned in the book in the same order , the yardbirds , john mayall , cream , blind faith , derek and the dominos , etc . to keep things in context.the stories that were recounted , both professional and personal were often heartbreaking tragedies that were hard to read ( i rarely read autobiographies ) .it was hard for me to grasp how someone could put themselves through such anguish . this book is very engaging , which more than compensates for the fact it could have been edited a little better.in the end , this truly is a story of triumph over adversity . in other words , clapton has lived the blues .
= a real blues story
< a story of triumph over adversity

> i 'm getting so used to in the ear earphones that i was surprised for a minute , that these sit just outside the ear . the effect it has is that you are listening to the radio , but can hear all the background noise perfectly clearly . i liked that for walking down busy new york streets and still being able to hear a car horn or your name being called out ( i 've had friends accuse me of 'blanking them ' when i was wearing other noise cancelling headsets . ) my only concern that they were a bit fiddly for me to put on and because i wear glasses with quite thick plastic arms , it felt a bit crowded behind my ears . i think if i wore ultrathin wire frames ( or no glasses at all ) it would n't be an issue , but the these ear pieces are thicker than normal and it was n't immediately comfortable.sound quality was good , and connection to the rest of the world was also good , comfort was average , i liked them .

> ifscreamadelicawas about acid dance andgive out do n't give upacid blues , 2000s xtmntr is about acid noise.this album never leaves the attack . the first two thirds are dominated by heavy guitars . equally stomping dance music completes xtmntr , but the two parts seem like connected parts of a black tunnel.the thread is the production . all tracks are run through electronic processing : not to create a sheen for sales but to give this music the icy , futuristic detachment that matches the album 's creepy nuance . this was made in 2000 , but if asked i would swear xtmntr was recorded after september 11th.i have always had a liking for primal scream . i do n't play them often but every few years i play their albums back to back . what keeps me engaged is what keeps most of us engaged in the best artists : finding an individual sound and running it through virtually limitless forms of music .

> mystery fiction does n't get any better than this one . although it 's the fourth in a series , it works as a stand-alone . we 're given short introductions to six separate and unrelated people who end up killed in a restaurant shooting . one of the victims is the teenage nephew of jane candiotti 's police detective husband . it would appear that one victim was the intended one and the others are shot as witnesses , so a key factor is the investigation of the background of each victim . the author details all this in a way that reveals various surprises about individual victims as the book progresses . few readers are likely to figure it out , but the ending is beautifully consistent . those who re-read the beginning after reading the entire book will have `` ah ha ! '' reactions.this is a skillful procedural and a most satisfying read for any mystery fan .
= superlative ! ! !
< a skillful procedural

> the basic plot of this book is interesting : lucifer is given a `` good deal '' by god . take control of a mortal body for one month , and if he wishes to remain human afterwards , he will be reinstated into heaven when his body dies . on that `` hook '' lies a very funny work . of course the devil is n't seriously interested in redemption ; he just wants to enjoy walking on earth and tasting its pleasures . along the way we get some really humorous insights about what `` actually '' happened behind the stories we 're told from the bible . you wo n't like this book if you take your religious history seriously , but even a believer can have a little fun now and again . remember , it 's just fiction ! take it for what it 's worth and enjoy the ride .

> dementia 13 was francis ford coppola 's feature film debut . for that reason alone the movie is worth watching . however , besides that fact , the film stands up as a fairly decent piece of classic thriller/horror . in many ways the movie parallels another thriller/horror classic : psycho . both films begin with a beautiful blond committing a crime who ends up coming to an untimely and gruesome demise about halfway through the story . though psycho hid the identity of the killer a little better , it 's pretty obvious in both films who the murderer is . the acting in the film is believable and the use of lighting is rather creative , adding to the movie 's tone . overall , an underrated horror classic worth watching on its own merit 's and not just those of its director .

> valery gergiev and the kirov orchestra yield a magnificient performance of stravinsky 's & quot ; rite of spring & quot ; that emphasizes the raw , barbaric quality of the score . this is by far the most dynamic recording i 've heard of this work , pulsating with much raw , emotional energy . gergiev leads his forces in a series of sonic explosions from the woodwinds , brass and percussion . as for the scriabin , it is an interesting choice highlighting the young stravinsky 's musical ties to the older russian composer ; this performance seems far more restrained , and slightly less compelling than a carnegie hall performance of this work that i heard earlier this year with gergiev conducting the kirov orchestra . still , this cd is worth acquiring just for gergiev 's dynamic interpretation of stravinsky .

> i thoughta feast for crows : a song of ice and fire : book four ( martin , george rr ) was somewhat disappointing . and , after making fans wait so long for book five , i was concerned that martin was losing steam . i am so happy to have been wrong . this book was my favorite in the series so far.i could n't disagree more with the reviewers who complain that martin spent too long building up to things that never happened . i thought that martin did an incredible job of building suspense in this book . some of the story lines had great climaxes in this book ; others are set up perfectly for a hugely eventful book six.i was also very impressed by martin 's ability to introduce new characters and plot lines that quickly drew me in . in the earlier books , i frequently found that some chapters were much more engaging than others . but in a dance with dragons , i never had that feeling of wanting to get through a chapter so that i could get to a more interesting one.i will admit that tyrion 's story ( which was always one of my favorites in the other books ) is a bit disappointing in this one . at first , i was also a bit let down by daenerys 's story , but as i kept reading i realized that the earlier chapters were the perfect setup for the end of the book.i do n't think i 've ever felt as engaged in a story as i was reading this book . i felt sad to have finished it , and i can not wait for book six .

> it 's only nine years after this cd was released -- and now i discover it . thank goodness it called to me from the used cd store ! love this music . their cover of percy sledge 's & # 34 ; warm & tender love & # 34 ; sends chills up my spine . on first listen , i did n't realize it was a cover , but this soul-to-country transplant has rooted into a glorious track with caitlin & thad 's vocals filling the tune with such love and longing , & # 34 ; i have loved you a long long time ; darlin ' , please say you 'll be mine. & # 34 ; the opener , & # 34 ; two different things , & # 34 ; relates a busted-heart love affair with some great trailer park anguish , & # 34 ; i wished we cared enough to fight about it now & then. & # 34 ; i also really like & # 34 ; waiting on june & # 34 ; with its slow sadness melting with the lovely harmonies that spark between these two , & # 34 ; it 's a winter day again & it seems like it might last for ages. & # 34 ; there are no poor tracks on this lovely set . if you 're like me and have n't discovered this , by all means try it out . enjoy !

> got this for my wife , an avid reader . this is the first e-book reader she has ever used and , like most first time users , she was a bit intimidated the first time she saw the device . after a few hours reviewing the controls and functions , she downloaded her first free preview and saw just how easy it was to use . the amazon store is n't the most user friendly ( lots of choices , but a bit difficult to work your way through all the categories and no easy way to spot a specific type of book you 're looking for ) , but she managed to find several possible titles she was interested in . the kindle is , by far , nicer and lighter than the nook ( our daughter-in-law has one and they contrasted them side-by-side shortly after i gave her the kindle ) . battery life is as advertised . screen size and anti-glare are outstanding . all in all , she loves it and has downloaded and read several books already on it . in her words , `` sure beats holding a hard cover or soft cover book for several hours ! '' i highly recommend this product for the first time e-book buyer .

> these days , it has became more important to keep a little bit of backup for your electronics on the go . unfortunately , that has been a problem that many people have felt with the iphone , or other electronic devices . but for anybody whom owns a ipod or a iphone , they have to find something else to deliver . energizer has delivered nicely with their instant charger , which requires their lithium aa batteries . it actually works very well on the ipod touch as well as the iphone 4 as well . you do n't have to waste your time bringing that connector out with you , when you have to either charge it up , or sync it to the computer when you need to add your music . it works very well , and is definitely better than the duracell backups for the iphone , where you would have to charge them up by computer , and bring your connector out with you to keep it charged up . this works well , and is definitely a great buy , for all your iphone and ipod touch needs.price : bsetup : b+overall : b 1/2+

> a good friend of mine who is a veterinarian , recommended this book to me several years ago . based on her review , i purchased the book and it sat on my bookshelf for three years ! ! i considered reading it several times , but it was always passed over in favor of other novels that sounded more intriguing . once i started seeing trailers for the movie adaptation of the novel with reese witherspoon and robert pattinson , i finally extracted the book from its place in the bookshelf and read it . thank goodness i did ! water for elephants is a brilliantly written account of a veterinarian student who loses his parents in a car crash and ends up joining a circus in a chance encounter . the author clearly depicts what circus life was like in the 1930s and builds larger than life circus folk whose personalities bounce off of the novel 's pages . i highly recommend water for elephants , it 's a story of loss , love , animals , circus shenanigans , and betrayal . it 's a fun romp with a great ending that you 'll thoroughly enjoy .
= delightful peek into the early 20th century circus world

> i would have given five stars to this collection of george michael music if it had included some of his hits with the pop duo group , `` wham , '' from the 1980s like `` last christmas '' and `` freedom version '' and others that i remember like `` wake me up before you go go . '' just because he went solo does n't mean he can forget those wham years . he was really instrumental in making a wham success . maybe he could n't get the rights to the music but his rendition of `` last christmas '' and his wham songs are worth listening too.during the wham years , the music was mellow and shallow but his musical career matured after he went solo . his songs on this collection like `` praying for time , '' `` freedom , '' `` careless whisper , '' and his duets with aretha franklin and sir elton john and the song , `` somebody to love '' with queen are fantastic but i still miss his wham songs which would have earned five stars easy .

> we recently decided to stop using our dish washing machine and go back to doing dishes by hand . i was curious about how this might work instead of our regular plastic dish drainer . well , i must admit , i like the idea- in theory ... however , the reality-for me- did n't exactly work . after washing dishes and laying them on this mat ... the water just collects there standing on dishes and mat . there is zero absorbtion . at least with the standard dish drainer , the water drains off into the sink because of the angle . with this product the water just collects and stays there ... and since i do n't live in a warm climate , it does n't evaporate fast enough , so i still have to dry them later.i guess this product , was n't useful to me as a mat to lay dishes on ... however , i did find that it was useful for putting under my pet food dispenser , it washes easily , and is soft and spongy and attractive looking .
= cute , but did n't work for me ... .

> what i love about this book is that its not another one of those books that tells you whats best for you and your kids . from stories about the baby-proofing craze and nudity in front of your kids , real moms tell it like it is , and how well their lives work when they do n't take the expert advice . it goes to show that `` their '' way is n't the only way and not always the right away , and that women 's intuition will always be a mother 's best guide . this really is a must for every mom out there ! i could relate to the stories and found that these women were just like me in a lot of ways , and they made me feel less of an outcast in my own parenting decisions and helped show me that i 'm not the only one who goes against the grain ! a definite must for parents and women !

> you wonder how an author could conceive , let alone execute , a book like this . it is truly one of those rare books that will fascinate readers of all ages . it will become a classic . you will want to spend the rest of your life visiting zoos -- unless you are one of the pathetic few who suffer from zd ( `` zoo derangement '' ) . and you will never take to the water in a boat out of sight of land and not recall this epic voyage of a boy and a tiger . you will never look at a tiger -- or mankind , for that matter -- the same way again . and , as a character in the book says : `` this story will make you believe in god .

> why people love this movie so much is beyond me . it was entertaining but nothing special . i do n't know what the best animated movie of all time is , but if this truly is it then animated movies as a category must be junk . and whatever that oscar-winning song was , which was not all that memorable in the movie , is not better than & # 34 ; happy & # 34 ; .the one thing seriously missing from the plot of this moving is any indication of why this girl has this frozen power . right away we find out she can freeze things , but why ? maybe i 'm too picky and i should have just gone with it . but it bugged me .

> i 'm not much of a water snob , but i do notice a real difference in the quality of water from different sources . of course , bottled water does taste better than my local tap water . no surprise there . what surprised me about glaceau smartwater is just how good it tastes . there 's a real clearness and cleanness to the water that is really refreshing . my only regret is that i only had one bottle before my wife and her friends drank the rest . glaceau smartwater is a bit more expensive , but if i ever need bottled water again this will be at the top of my list .

> the tenth doctor starts life with a bang and keeps on going . alien invasion during christmas , werewolves coming after the queen , clockwork robots in france , cybermen , daleks , satan and lots of comedy . this doctor , david tennant , has a new style but just as much energy as the past doctors . he is both a man of action but also has a strong sense of ethics and beliefs that guide him even when all seems lost.all the episodes have commentary , the dvds have lots of outtakes , deleted scenes and specials . a must for all dr. who fans .

> i confess . i have an 11 year old granddaughter , but i would have read the harry potter books anyway ! i am well-educated , with an a.b . and j.d . really good children 's books are not limited by age . the 3d book in the harry potter series is by far the best -- -and the other two are excellent . they are for all ages , not just the young . you should discuss the ethical issues with your children/grandchildren . the stories captivate both young and old .

> coming out when the 2nd-gen alterna-acts we 're just catching wind , eels debut has demonstrated a longer importance then many less distinguished acts of the time . while there is not enough personality to warrant high praise ( the band autopilot 's in their drearily hip mode a little too often ) , chief songwriter `` e '' demonstrates keen dark-pop chops by way of piano or guitar , creating a few hauntingly upbeat , not to mention sardonically lyricized snapshots amongst less memorable , but still competent tracks .

> jack nicholson is r.p . mcmurphy , prison inmate , trouble-maker , wiseguy , and aspiring lunatic . he 's just gotten himself committed to the nuthouse in order to escape work detail at the prison . mcmurphy figures he 's hit the jackpot ! he believes he 's fooled everyone , and will simply coast out his remaining term . then he meets nurse mildred ratched ( louise fletcher ) , the jagged rocks upon which mcmurphy 's freedom boat will crash . nurse ratched is a pompous , manipulative , poker-faced witch . she hides a seething evil behind her blank expression . mcmurphy takes her on , thinking he can defeat her with his sarcasm and wit . all he wants is to let the other & quot ; nuts & quot ; have a little fun in their otherwise dull , suffocatingly controlled lives . he breaks out and takes them all on a fishing trip at sea . he gets the guys to play blackjack , and acts out the play-by-play of an imaginary ballgame when nurse ratched foils his plans to watch the world series on tv . finally , mcmurphy sneeks booze and babes into the ward . nurse ratched is not amused ! she must show mcmurphy who is truly in command . ofotcn is a tale of institutional terror . should anyone , regardless of mental state , be treated like children ? should they be controlled / medicated in a way that turns them into vegetables ? can & quot ; professionals & quot ; be trusted with the care of those they are supposed to help ? or will they just warehouse them , treating them like animals in captivity ? what if the doctors or nurses themselves are secretly , silently harmful ? this movie explores some of the darkest recesses of humanity , leaving us with lots of questions and a lump in our throat . ultimately , ofotcn is about freedom in the face of tyranny . highest recommendation ...

> fans of david weber 's `` honor harrington '' series will not be disappointed with the latest , `` at all costs '' , published shortly after the 200th anniversary of the battle of trafalgar . while weber is not nearly as elegant a prose stylist as either c. s. forester or especially , patrick o'brian , he is still a fine storyteller , yielding once more yet another rousing tale about the fortunes of admiral honor harrington . much to his credit , weber offers us some fascinating glimpses into the political machinations in new paris , the capital of the republic of haven , providing us with some of the most sympathetic portraits he 's given the reader of havenite political and military leaders such as president eloise pritchart and admirals thomas theisman and lester tourville . he also finally resolves the long-standing romantic triangle of harrington , hamish alexander , earl white haven , and emily alexander , alexander 's crippled wife , with some rather surprising twists and turns.the star kingdom of manticore is losing the new war against the newly reconstituted democratic republic of haven . in desperation , the admiralty turns to harrington , offering her command of eighth fleet , which she uses to probe deep into havenite space , leading a series of diversionary raids - mostly successful - that help reduce the republic of haven 's numerical superiority in warships , weapons systems and personnel ( manticore still holds a distinctive , but rapidly diminishing , technological edge over its havenite foe. ) . in new paris , senior officials of pritchart 's administration uncover tantalizing evidence pointing to an unseen third party - which weber foolishly discloses i think - that started the new war and is manipulating events , both militarily and politically . the stage is set for an interstellar `` battle of trafalgar '' which admiral harrington must win `` at all costs '' , even if she has to sacrifice family and friends to accomplish her mission .

> sophie , duchess of calton , had mourned the loss of her first love , garrett , after his death during the battle at waterloo . seven years later , she marries tristan , best friend to both her and her husband . tristan and sophie are happy - until the day garrett comes back into their lives.garrett is n't quite himself when he returns to his old life . years of amnesia had him working in the belgium countryside , unaware of his titles , his responsibilities or sophie . back in england , he wants his wife back and his friendship with tristan might as well not have happened.sophie is stuck between her love for both men . garrett was her first love , but tristan is the man she craves . is there is a way for them all to live happily or will someone get hurt ? i was intrigued by the premise of a hint of wicked , but ultimately felt let down . before garrett came back , both men seemed like truly wonderful characters , men any woman would have a hard time choosing between , which is what interested me . but as we got to garrett , even with his sympathetic situation , i just did n't want him to get sophie back . and as the intrigue developed ( too late ) , it just was n't enough . sophie 's love for both men was mentioned so often , i was surprised it was n't on every page . and there were some interesting storylines that were left undeveloped and thus were unfulfilling.niki leereviewed for joyfully reviewed

> since my late teens i have had an issue with impacted wisdom teeth ( decided to come in sideways ) unfortunately i do not have dental insurance or i would have them pulled . anyone who has had wisdom teeth issues know how much of a pain they can be as food can get stuck between them . i mainly purchased this to help with that issue and to keep my back teeth healthy , and it works wonders.with the variable speeds and heads you will be able to find a setup that you are comfortable with , adults all the way down to kids should be able to use this with no problems . the tank holds sufficient water to go over both the top and bottom , front and back of your gum-line without refilling . this unit can also handle mouthwash and or anti-bacterial oral solutions without an issue . it also includes heads for those of you who may have braces.i have noticed a significant decrease in tartar around my gum-line . my only real complaint is the unit runs continuously all the time when it 's on . the button on the handle will stop the flow for a few seconds , i keep thinking however that it should be the other way around ( button turns flow on instead ) . so if you forget to push the button in before removing it the water will squirt all over.also , i have had no issues with leakage like a few have claimed . over all this is a terrific product and will give a big boost to your dental health .

> by it 's third season , it was clear the x-files was n't what everyone had expected from the time it had premiered . now , creator chris carter begins to bring the long running alien conspiracy story arc to the forefront ; and this season is nothing short of brilliant , and is possibly the best season in the show 's history ( and that is saying something ) . david duchovny and gillian anderson are perfect as ever as fbi agents mulder and scully respectively ; and this season contains some of the series ' most memorable episodes . it was also in season 3 that the series ' style of subdued satirical comedy began to shine , but it is the mythology of the series that made this season go excellent . standout episodes ( and there are aplenty ) include the season opener the blessing way , paper clip , oubliette , nisei , 731 , war of the coprophages , grotesque , pusher , avatar , and quagmire ; but the main season ( and series ) highlights include clyde bruckman 's final repose ( which features a standout performance from peter boyle ) and jose chung 's & quot ; from outer space & quot ; which features a great commentary track from fan favorite series vets darin morgan and rob bowman ( both of whom helped craft the brilliance of the show ) . all in all , this is possibly the best season of the x-files , and if this handsome package came in widescreen format this would be essential .

> the unit is fairly quiet , and i have n't seen much degradation in the rechargeable batteries after using it for about three dozen labels and purposefully leaving it on for an extended period : not being tethered to a cord makes this unit very convenient as you walk around your home or office and use it in other rooms . the touch screen is very handy for quickly changing fonts and formats.the lettering is very crisp , and comes with a variety of fonts and font sizes - more than i will every need ( i am a boring accountant ) . this unit prints about 4x faster than the similar-sized brother printer i have in my office , and one of the better features is i can save repetitive-type label formats in the printer 's memory for use at a later date and time : i wish i would have had this unit several years ago as i ca n't tell you how much time i have wasted in the past setting a similar structure up for different types of home vs. office type filing structures.about the only `` negative '' i have , and it 's not much of a negative is this label maker is a little larger than i was expecting - about as large as my 10-key calculator - but the size is necessary in order to have reasonable-sized keys for the full keyboard which i appreciate as it helps prevent fat-fingering the words you are trying to type out for a label .

> stunt , after stunt , after stunt almost obliterates this film 's attempt to return the james bond series to its original origins . roger moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility . it is interesting how the level of physical stunts that james bond is required to perform increases proportionally with roger moore 's age with each new film.the first two thirds of the film are good , very good , classic bond . however , the film falls asleep in the third . when you 've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress , you 've seen 'em all . bill conti 's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive . it is in the final third of the film that conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring which only contributed to the anti climatic finale.the sinking of the st. georges , the attack on kristatos ' warehouse and bond kicking locque 's car , with locque still inside , off the cliff were high points that were excellently filmed.in all john glen 's directorial debut as the primary director on a bond film is a good one . director glen 's second unit work on on her majesty 's secret service is well documented . his excellence shows her in for your eyes only . john glen 's enormous contributions to the bond series seem to have gone unsung and somehow forgotten . let us not forget .

> from the opening performance of the schumann paino concerto , you would peg helene grimaud as a cool modernist with a light french touch . she is joined by salonen , himself a musician who takes a chilly view of the romantics ( when he conducts them at all ) . together , they produce a very unsentimental but sensitive reading that happens to be in exceptionally good sound . the ability of engineers to capture the actual sound of a concert grand piano is improving every day . the staatskapelle dresden plays elegantly . if you want a schumann a minor that 's almost chaste but very well articulated , grimaud 's is a perfect choice.she then goes on to prove herself a bit of a chameleon in the three lieder by clara schumann , with their restless accompaniment that often overshadow the vical part . equally turbulent are the two brahms rhapsodies , although i think grimaud strains a bit to sound individual . we 're back to neutral territory in the brahms cello sonata # 1 with turls monk , in which both soloists are highly controlled and , if not cool , not abandoned by any means.in all , an imaginative program shows off several sides of this mercurial artist . i 'm not sure i really know who the real helene grimaud is , but her pianism is certainly appealing .

> when alfred hitchcock presents first aired on cbs in 1955 , it was an instant hit . my parents even suspended the regular school night curfew for my sister and me so we could stay up to watch the show . & # 34 ; revenge & # 34 ; is the show 's pilot episode , and even if it is n't one of the very best episodes , it was representative of the series . it 's a good story with nice performances by ralph meeker and vera miles . hitchcock , who directed the episode , was impressed enough with vera miles that he cast her as a co-star a few years later in his film & # 34 ; psycho. & # 34 ; there 's also an appearance by frances bavier , who would go on to fame as aunt bee in the andy griffith show a few years later.we did n't know it at the time , but alfred hitchcock presents would become one of the best anthology series in the history of tv . today , it 's fun to watch the old episodes to see roles being played by then-unknown actors and actresses who went on to become major stars in tv and movies .

> this book is a sort of double edged sword for me . you really root for the navy seal 's out there in the back lines of afghanistan , but at the same time , you get distracted by the author 's political view on liberals , politicians , and so forth . i just wish he could have stuck to the story about how they fought to the death , alamo style . in that respect , it truly is a heroic story . and these guys are brave , no doubt about it , but when you read a book that has an author that despises liberals as much as the taliban , it 's a bit hard to swallow . the funny thing is that i 'm not even a liberal , but it was even hard for me to take . just the facts ma'am , alright ? by the way , a much better book on this subject is 'bravotwozero ' by andy mcnab . he 's a british elite sas member stuck behind enemy lines with four others in iraq . sound familiar ? it is , but more than anything , it concentrates on the battle at hand , not the political battle at home .

> argentinean-american gusto santaolalla has an ear for simple , sparse , but romantic background music . `` snow '' , `` riding horses '' , `` the wings '' and the title song are all original and worthy pieces of work , but they are all too short , clocking in at a minute or two each . that 's a disappointment , as any extended version would be welcome . the contributions from emmylou harris , rufus wainwright , jackie green and willie nelson are all perfect choices for an early 1960 's western . only linda ronstadt seems out of place with her pop rock entry . it 's a good soundtrack , but it just does n't live up to the grandeur deserved for such a fine film . teddy thompson and rufus wainwright 's cover duet of roger miller 's `` king of the road '' , is a special treat .

> this book was a really good read . the characters were well developed and the emotional toll that was taken on each of them was so well written , you could feel it , understand it and sympathize with it all the way around . the story was of right and wrong , about lies building on lies and although you knew what would be the right thing to do , you did n't know if you could do it , or was it really the right thing ? this book really made you think . the fact that it is a debut novel for this writer is amazing . it 's written as if it 's a third , fourth or nineteenth book ! very well written ! i recommend it anyone looking for a good read by the fireplace . make sure you have tissues handy .

> taking off from the true story of mormon fundamentalist brothers who murdered in the name of divine revelation , krakauer delves into the depths of radical mormon sects with diabolical leaders , all in the name of true faith . he goes all the way back to joseph smith & # 65533 ; s violent journey to utah where , no surprise , he receives a message from on high that bigamy is just fine with god . krakauer & # 65533 ; s ability as a writer to render the story right up front and in your face with superb dialogue and scene setting makes for a compelling read . the recent kidnapping , brainwashing , and sexual abuse of elizabeth smart fed in a timely way into this books publication release.one thing for sure : krakauer knows how to hold our attention .

> my soon-to-be fourth grader reads at an advanced level and so i thought this book titled `` middle-school cool '' might appeal to her . she read it within two days ( as she went about her other summer activities ) and her verdict was , `` it is ok. not really my cup of tea . '' well , at least she finished it . i picked it up to read next since i was curious as to what she did n't like about it . the situations are rather zany , although there is some effort put into building characterization . i 'm not altogether convinced middle schoolers behave and talk the way they are portrayed in this book . i guess this depends on one 's reading tastes and the book 's reading target group is probably ages 9-12 .

> the hobbit takes you on a wonderful adventure as you enter the realm of bilbo baggins . this book is adventure at it 's best as bilbo joins 13 dwarves who are seeking to take their gold back from the dragon smaug who destroyed their kingdom . the hobbit provides one action packed adventure after another from the hobbit hole to the lonely mountain . bilbo 's riddle game with gollum was particularly intriuging and has a direct tie to lotr . the hobbit is also a fantastic character story as bilbo goes from a homebound hobbit leading a life of comfort to finding something deeper within himself on the adventure . the biggest flaw in the hobbit is there are way too many of those songs , most of which do n't add much to the story . the one that starts `` far over the misty mountains cold to dungeons deep and caverns old we must away ere break of day to seek the pale enchanted gold . '' is good , but most of the rest could have been edited out to make the book flow better for the reader . it should also be pointed out that there are no female characters in this book . the lack of female characters disqualifes this book for 5 star status because the best fantasy is also that which is most realistic and having no female characters made bilbo 's world feel less realistic . but in spite of unneccasary songs that drag the story and the lack of female characters the engrossing quality of adventure and the strength of the main character make the hobbit a satisfying read that deserves a well earned 4 stars .

> i viewed this without subtitles so even with my headphones on , i missed about 20 % of the speech . had i heard it all , i probably would have given a five star rating . at any rate , with so many ratings already in , i need only add my vote to the many : this is a fine picture for those who want balletic action with a story that keeps one in its grip until the final curtain . the star does a first rate job and is well supported ; wisely , the truly dramatic high-jinks in the use of handheld weapons is accentuated by its sparing use . the new age story follows a general pattern : chief enforcer of a new society dominated by a small elite and subjected by direct force and drugs taken by the population is freed by accident from the impact of the drugs and comes to see things as they are . his life takes a new turn ( which i should not describe to avoid revealing what it is better not to know beforehand ) . his ability to love and hate is revived , as is his capacity to think and evaluate his situation and that of the new society.i found it engrossing throughout and a winning yet quite human action film .

> not being a fan of the video game that inspired this movie , i must admit i found it visually stunning but ultimately confusing and empty . from reading other reviews , some of the enormous plot holes make sense , but if a movie is n't honest enough to let all viewers know what 's going on , then has it achieved its goal as entertainment ? the sets , atmosphere and effects are marvelous , but the performances are lacking , with the exception of alice krige as the nutty spiritual leader . but once again , we have yet another movie in which a demonic little girl wants to possess another innocent little girl . been there , done that , and frankly i wish writers would come up with something a little more inventive .

> like a prayer is madonnas 1989 release and her 4th studio album is not one of my favorite madonna albums . still it has many fine tracks , i.e. , express yourself , cherish , keep it together and dear jessie . i never liked like a prayer mostly because i do not like gospel music . the book-let is so so . the cover art is confusing . i have no idea what she meant with this one . we get a nice list of personnel and muisicians and who played what . the lyrics could have been in a bit larger font as i find it a bit small . the center photo is a bit strange with a pose that is supposed to mean something that i have no idea what . 4/5 .

> bands do n't need to be different for the sake of being different , but i prefer when each cd a band creates is a separate entity from the ones that have come before them . x & y is basically a clone of rush of blood to the head but lacking the few essential differences that would make this something other than a tired retread . the same sound , the ethereal production , but now it 's wearing thin because you sit there and say `` have n't we heard this before ? '' i do n't really dislike the sound , but x & y is just pleasant background noise . here 's hoping the next time out the band puts a little edge on their music .

> karen essex 's leonardo '' s swans is an extraordinary marriage of 15th century political and sexual intrigue revolving around sisters isabella and beatrice d'este.isabella , the eldest sister , is beautiful , ambitious and accomplished . her sister beatrice grew up undisciplined in her grandfather 's home and is awkward , less accomplished and initially lacks political ambitions.isabella marries handsome francesco gonzaga , a minor aristocrat , who aspires to greatness . beatrice has been betrothed and marries the future duke of milan , ludovico sforza who loves his mistress and only wants a wife to bear him sons . he is powerful , determined and wants all that he sees , including isabella.isabella initially encourages ludovico 's attention and intends to use his infatuation with her to procure a portrait of herself from resident artist , leonardo da vinci.the young sisters develop a political and sexual rivalry that sets up the first part of the novel for the political intrigue that occurs in the second half as the rulers of france try to invade italy.brothers-in-law ludovico and francesco are at odds in their loyalties and grasp for power . it is that lust for power that costs the d'este sisters everything.author essex weaves a fascinating tale that is made so much better by the stories of isabella and beatrice and the inclusion of the idiosyncrasies of leonardo da vinci.i found the political intrigue tedious at times but the author 's intensity , wonderful storytelling , intricate descriptions and full-bodied and richly developed characters made leonardo 's swans a compelling and extraordinary read.armchair interviews says : leonardo 's swans is more than historical fiction , it is a richly drawn view of the 15th century and those that inhabit the landscape .

> skylander 's is a great game venue for younger children . it has different levels of play , the characters are kid-friendly , and the graphics are good . my 10 year-old plays this game regularly with the 6 year-old next door and that 's one of the best aspects of the game to me -- that it can bring together kids in different age groups.general info about 'giants ' -- all figures work on the old portal. -- there are now 15 power levels. -- the starter kit ( not this one ) is a better value for some because you get more characters . although my child already had 'cynder'.play -- giant offers new characters who are stronger and whose eyes light up when they are on the portal . ( this is definitely a cool addition ) -- the landscape is a mix of new and old 'adventure packs ' with a mix of new and old enemies. -- there are only 16 chapters , versus 24 that came with the original spyro gameconclusions and other notes -- my son bought this with his own money so i am letting his opinion guide the star ratings. -- my 10 year-old played the entire game in a little under 10 hours . which is about $ 5/hour so maybe he 's right and this game offers a fair return on the dollar when compared to game parlors. -- definitely take note of what you get in this kit and the starter kit . it did n't make much difference to my son who has dozens of characters , but for newer players there can be more value in the sk.pam t~

> we have two dogs . both rescues . a beautiful black german shepherd and a little terrier mix . when i got cloud star king voltaire natural dog treat ( chicken pot pie ) i immediately opened the package and called my dogs . they came and sat at my feet , tails wagging expectantly . when i handed a cookie to each , they just stared at it . when i tried to put in their mouths , they politely held it there and then dropped it on the floor and just stared at at . after a few moments , i broke the cookie into smaller bits and handed it to each of them . this time they hesitantly ate it . i thought it was just to be polite because both our dogs are very civilized . but after they had a chance to taste and consider the treats , they now are eager to have a snack and really like the unusual taste of these natural and healthy treats that also seem to clean their teeth . i have tasted the treats myself and it is a rather pleasant flavor . i think their initial hesitancy was due to their never having tasted chicken pot pie . it 's not a part of their diet -- even on holidays . ( i am assuming this fine product comes from graduates of cal poly 's san luis obispo campus . ) i recommend it to dog lover 's who care about providing an authentically natural and healthy diet for their beloved pets .

> clownhouse ( victor salva , 1988 ) i really do n't want to say clownhouse is a bad film . i mean , you 've got a standup comic ( tree ) dressed up as a psychotic killer clown menacing three teenage boys with his two equally psychotic associates . it 's a late-eighties horror flick . i mean , how bad can it be ? well , the answer is , pretty bad . and as much as the recent rash of email chain letters attempting to get salva 's films boycotted drives me to want to contribue to salva 's coffers , i 'd rather watch powder for twenty-four hours back-to-back than sit through this dog again . salva enjoys descending into the realm of teen sex comedy humor all too often , including the inevitable masturbation jokes . salva ( who also wrote the screenplay ) has a less then fine ear for dialog . at times , in fact , it gets positively hideous.it probably says more than i ever could about the film that only two of the ten top-billed actors in the film , sam rockwell ( whose film debut was clownhouse , and who has since gone on to such films as the green mile , heist , and galaxy quest ) and karlheinz teuber ( coming back to the screen next year in kung phooey ) , made more than one film after clownhouse.do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague . * 1/2

> with the kentucky derby about one week away , it will be like ncaa march madness where even the casual of sports fans is going to have an opinion on the outcome.but maybe you will want to take that opinion one step further and place a bet at the local race track or otb that 's simulcasting the race . this book will help you learn the nomenclature associated with wagering on the races and the nuances to betting.author richard eng guides the reader through the basic bets like win , place and show , but really earns high marks by delving into the exotic bets - like exactas , trifectas and superfectas - where betting the same money as you would on the traditional trio may yield much higher payouts.the book is not how to handicap races , which is the art or reading a racing form or researching with other material to select runners for your various bets . it purely focuses on understanding what bets are possibly available for the races at your local tracks or on the simulcasts.and with confidence , you 'll be able to march up to the teller and state - for the record - `` in race five i 'd like an exacta box with with 2 and the 6 , '' just like a pro . and through the help of eng you will certainly understand it just as well or better than that `` expert '' who 's next in line .

> i was quite surprised when i read this book , and really did n't know what to expect . however , this young lady has quite a keen insight to what today 's teenage girls are experiencing and she takes each thing , breaks it down , shares her own experiences , then tells girls how to handle these situations in their own lives . the biggest problem ? little to no self esteem in young girls which mostly stems from the type of relationship the girl has with her own dad . lucado tells how they possibly got there and how to turn to god to get out . my only complaint is that i think that she touches on the subjects , has the reader write down their own experiences within the confines of the book , but really , there 's a book that could be dedicated to each of the 14 chapters contained within the book . it 's pretty neat to have the girls write down their experiences because it will be a neat thing to have and look back on years from now . i thoroughly enjoyed the helpful tips lucado brings and hope that she continues to encourage and to teach young girls how to accept themselves and to see themselves how god sees them . great book , highly recommend for all ages , actually ! i learned a lot and i 'm in my 40s ! thanks for the book !

> if you are looking for pure stevia , this one is it . it has no other ingredients than stevia.i recently switched from artificial sweeteners like splenda to stevia and have been very satisfied . splenda was spiking my blood sugar which i have n't had at all with stevia . i think it tastes great and i taste no aftertaste at all . all the research i have done has confirmed the good news about stevia . stevia is natural so you really should n't taste an aftertaste . since it 's natural , it does not have an aftertaste such as a fake taste or artificial taste like splenda or nutrasweet . for some people if you use too much , you could taste a herbal taste . honestly , i taste nothing but sweetness . it is a different sweetness than sugar though so if you 're just use to refined white sugar then you might have to get use to it but use just a little and i think you 'll be pleased.the price seems high compared to some other sweeteners but a little goes a long way . the bottle comes with a scoop and the scoop is tiny , i mean tiny and just a scoop is just enough for me in most drinks so this bottle will last a long , long time .
= pure stevia

> led bulbs offer many benefits , most notably little or no heat and great light output , while using just a small fraction of the electricity of an incandescent . however , it can be a problem finding an led that fits into some fixtures , especially those with shades that clip onto the bulb.this bulb solves that problem perfectly . it & # 8217 ; s shaped just like an incandescent but the guts are led technology . best of both worlds ! the light output is rated as 500 lumens which is equivalent to a 40-watt conventional bulb . that rating seems pretty accurate & # 8211 ; i used it to replace a 60 watt bulb on an entry-way table lamp , and the light output is just a tad less than the 60 watt it replaces . nice balanced light color.the build quality appears solid . i have several g7 power bulbs and none have given me any trouble whatsoever . i expect this will perform just as well as the other g7's.best of all , i can use it in an old lamp that i & # 8217 ; m quite fond of with a clip-on lamp shade . never thought i & # 8217 ; d be able to convert that lamp to an led.highly recommend !

> evil dead is an incredibly creepy , gooshingly gory , immensely entertaining movie . when you consider that sam raimi , bruce campbell , and their friends just decided to make a horror movie and went out and did it , it boggles the mind ! they were all just kids from michigan state university , on a top-secret ( so secret , they did n't know it themselves ) mission to make movie history . the result is an intense 85 minutes of dread and terror ! ash ( campbell ) and his friends are staying in a cabin in the middle of the deep woods . they have no idea that this particular cabin is the stomping-grounds for a demonic presence of pure evil . unleashed through a tape-recorded recitation , the dark forces descend upon ash and company , possessing them and playing sadistic games with each . death , oozing gore , and rape by a tree ( ! ! ) are only some of the things that make this unforgettable . turn out the lights and enjoy ...

> `` the code '' ( aka `` thick as thieves '' ) stars morgan freeman and antonio banderas , plus two of my favorite actors robert forster and radha mitchell . and somehow this heist movie went straight to dvd in america . this is no surprise after all , as the film ( directed by mimi leder , `` deep impact '' ) suffers from unfocused story , pedestrian direction and the least interesting and one-dimensional characters.a veteran art thief keith ripley ( freeman ) recruits a younger ( and daring ) crook gabriel martin ( banderas ) after witnessing the latter pull off a robbery in nyc subway . keith , who must repay his debt to a gangster , has been planning his final heist : stealing two faberg & eacute ; eggs worth $ 40 million from a museum . things get complicated when gabriel meets alexandra korolenko ( mitchell ) , a goddaughter of keith and daughter of a murdered russian mobster . gabriel tries to seduce her despite her godfather 's warning to leave her alone.the story is almost clich & eacute ; with those familiar types of characters , and not in the delightful way . the heist itself is uninteresting , lacking the details of the situation the characters must go through . the obligatory romance only slows down the action . a few twists and turns are thrown in , which i admit are unpredictable , but they only help make the whole confusing storyline more incomprehensible . `` the code '' looks as if concocted from the mediocre episodes of a caper tv show . even the usually reliable stars like freeman and banderas look bored .

> haley is the dutiful motherless preacher 's daughter who flees the coop after her fianc & eacute ; expresses second thoughts and wants to seek out adventure . in a kansas bar , she meets kevin , a us marshall who just wants a burger and a beer after spending hours in a car with a prisoner he just dropped off . he comes to innocent haley 's aid , and after taking her back to her motel room , she wants to get busy - he just wants to make sure she is okay . after getting injured in a prison riot and being told that he can not travel by plane , haley offers to take a detour to drop him off with his family in texas . the road trip proves to be quite a test for him - will he finally succumb to haley 's wholesomeness ? mallery is the rare prolific writer who churns out numerous books a year , yet rarely do they have a recycled feel to them . this was a nice contemporary take on `` it happened one night . '' the characters oozed chemistry , and the few times that they `` got busy '' were well written and did not border on an anatomy lesson . i liked haley 's growth as a character from shy innocent to inquisitive , then finally finding her own inner-strength to stand up for herself . i would have liked a more developed story - perhaps concentrating on haley 's relationship with her father prior to heading for hawaii ( in a car no less ) .

> granted , i 've only had the kindle 2 for three days and i am still getting used to it but it 's been a struggle . i 'm a mega-reader and a very fast reader and it has been a struggle to adjust to the electronic book format . i 'll continue to try it but i am already procrastinating reading with it vs. reading a traditional book.i only gave it 4 stars because i did n't realize that it has a dark blip when the page is turned . that slows me down and is very distracting . when i get to the bottom of the page , i have to read the last sentence very s-l-o-w-l-y and keep it in my mind because the dark blip is so distracting that i forget what i just read . i do n't think i can be faster at flipping the pages of the book then the speed of the dark blip so i am assuming that it takes a while to adjust . why have it though ? why not just have the second page appear , like scrolling through a pdf ? also , the `` turn page '' buttons are too hard to push . they should be able to be touched , not pushed . i also wish it had a wireless remote control so that i can lay the book down and effortlessly go to the next page.would i buy it again for $ 359 ? probably not but i plan to continue to become accustomed to my new toy .

> this is a lovely wwii era film that looks at life in a wisconsin farming community during the war and is composed of a series of vignettes that are related to a family of norwegian extraction , their relatives , and friends . it intermingles family , faith , friendship , patrotism , and a value system that exposes the best in humanity and at times the worst.while the story is interesting , it is the performances that attract special note . edward g. robinson is cast against type as the farmer . his character is absolutely believable as the hard working family man who wants nothing more than a new barn and a secure future for his family . agnes moorehead portrays his wife bruna . instead of reverting to her normal film persona , moorehead excels as the simple but intuitive farm wife who adapts to the hardships of farm life . margaret o'brien portrays their only child daughter selma who sees the world with childlike innocence and faith . child actor butch jenkins plays selma 's cousin arnold , who is at times selma 's adversary but more often her partner in crime when they head off on adventures . the interchanges between the two kids are funny and endearing and recall a much more innocent time.this film is so funny and endearing and sometimes sad that it is good example of good storytelling with minimal histrionics and special effects .

> margaret peterson haddix has become one of my favorite authors . this novel is her first and you can see the direction in which writing and creativity takes place . the story of people who live in 1840 and who believe they are living in 1840 in a clifton village community are mislead about the real world . well except for a few adults who know the truth about the real world , life in 1840 is rough and a diptheria epidemic could claim the loss of the children 's lives.jessie and her sister katie are sent out under darkness on a mission first to leave their world behind and find help in the actual year of 1996. to go from a year like 1840 and jump into 1996 without a time machine is pretty strange , the writer here makes it believable at times . her first novel shows her themes like children fighting back to change the world in which they live in . haddix is a great writer who prefers to write about such situations . i have already read 5 of her shadow children series books which i highly recommend for reading materials.haddix has such an amazing imagination of going into a dark place and returning without it effecting her attitude for a better , optimistic world in which we live during these serious times .

> the pursuit of one 's dream , no matter what the consequences , is what this movie is all about . tom hanks and sally field have stand-up comedy in their blood . but there are obstacles to achieving the dream of doing comedy : for hanks it 's his father who wants him to be a doctor ; for fields it 's a husband and family . hanks wants fields to run away with him , but fields has it out with her husband , explains her needs , and he buys into it . a lot of the movie takes place in comedy clubs where hanks can play his wacky role to the hilt , but fields seems out of place and not very funny : when she wins the contest at the end and then refuses to accept the prize in order to join her husband - this is called eating your cake and having it , too - it 's the biggest fraud of all . just not a very believable movie .

> dirt is the second novel in the stone barrington series by stuart woods . i know it 's early in the series but i am enjoying it . of course i like the holly barker and will lee series too . woods cranks out these book and i am glad . stone barrington is an ex-cop , a lawyer witha private practice that really works for a major law practice to well , take care of then dirty little case . and in this book woods establishes barington as some ladies man . in this book alone he goes through his good looking lady judge girl friend , has a little spin with amanda dart , meets nineteen year old tiffany potts , and then there is the introduction of addington carter ... even makes stone think , addington barrington , oh my . this novel is about scandal within the gossip industry if you can believe it . stone barrington is great beach reads . recommended.. on to dead in the water

> i did n't read the reviews until after i watch this pilot episode . i 'm really surprised . it was ok , that 's all . i 'd like to watch another episode before giving an excellent or i do n't like it review . it 's possible with some good writers this could turn out to be an excellent tv show . it the pilot almost feels like they are just throwing a bunch of possibilities out there so they can get a feel about which direction to go in with the story line . the characters need some improving . the only one i really like is the convict claiming innocence . the french actress and the prostitute have good character potential . if you 're into end of the world ( maybe ) time warp ( maybe ) alien invasion ( maybe ) everyone is already dead ( maybe ) type shows you 'll probably like this one .

> i love pyrex and have nothing but good things to say about it.pyrex products are very attractive and are high performance and high caliber . since pyrex products are made of glass , they do n't absorb odors and flavors and cleaning pyrex products is easy.these bowls fit nicely into one another and the tops fit perfectly . they seal in the flavor and do n't tend to slide off , pop off or cave in . you also have the volume of each bowl labeled on its corresponding top.since these bowls range in size from that of a soup bowl to one that you could fit a large dish in , you have plenty of storage options . they are your best friend in the kitchen when you want to put your food away for future meals .

> i was looking for a decaf chai tea and found this decaf vanilla chai tea which was even better . the addition of vanilla really enhances all the other spices and makes this tea sort of soothing . the ingredients include : decaffeinated black tea , natural flavors , chicory root , cardamom , ginger root , nutmeg , black pepper , star anise , cloves , panax ginseng leaves and vanilla extract . i like that i can drink this in the evening and not be awake all night . i think it is perfect with two tablespoons of dry milk and a packet of stevia . you could also use milk or cream to make a more authentic chai tea.~the rebecca review

> will ferrell , maggie gyllenhaal , emma thompson , queen latifah and dustin hoffman are perfectly cast in this story of a man who discovers he 's a fictional character whose creator is about to kill him off . will ferrell is a naturally sympathetic fellow who will tug at your heartstrings but not in a manipulative or contrived fashion . i 'm still not sure if the others around him were all fictional too , but in the end , it 's not a flaw in the story . just something to ponder .

> today , i tried out my third pair of powerline network adapters . i have been usingtrendnet 500 mbps powerline ethernet av adapters . my challenge was to add these actiontec powerline adapters to my network . yes , actiontec does play nice with trendnet . my whole house is networked now . all systems are go.instructions were very basic . just plug it in . there is no mention of what the little button on the bottom is for or even that it 's there . there 's a blurb about going online for information about changing the encryption key . when i go to the actiontec site , i ca n't find the information . there are lights on the powerline adapter , but no mention of those lights in the instructions . what does the blinking mean ? what do the colors mean ? my trendnet came with software that allows me to form a more secure private network . actiontec does n't come with any software . with my trendnet software , i was able to add the actiontec powerline adapters to my private network using the passwords printed on the actiontec powerline adapters.pros : + small adapter size ( much smaller than trendnet ) + quick setup+ comes with ethernet cable+ works with trendnet powerline adapterscons : - documentation is minimal- lack of software to configure a private networksummaryi do like the actiontec network adapter kit . it 's quick and easy to use . i 'm assuming changing the encryption key is supposed to help security somehow . i do n't know if changing it would then make it incompatible with my trendnet or not . i do n't know where to find that information easily , and i do n't ever like calling support . for now , i will rely on my private network provided through the trendnet software . if you do n't feel a need to configure your system , then actiontec powerline adapters will work just fine .

> i greatly enjoyedthe crossing places ( ruth galloway ) by the same author , but have not read the second book in the series , the janus stone . i was fortunate to receive this review copy through vine , and found the story compelling . i love the main protagonist , ruth galloway , who is a forensic archaeologist at north norfolk university . ruth is not a glamor puss , in fact she is far from it , a bookworm and unassuming . in this latest installment in the series , ruth is now a young mother , and struggling to cope with the rigors of balancing motherhood and her career.the mystery in this story centers on the discovery of the remains of six people located in a cove on the bleak norfolk coast , beneath a crumbling house ( hence the title , the house at sea 's end ) . it turns out that the remains might be german in origin , and dates to the second world war , which begs the question , `` how did they get there ? '' it also becomes evident that someone/ some persons will go to great lengths to keep the mystery hidden.ruth finds herself investigating the case together with dci harry nelson ( both have a history of sorts together , dating from the first novel ) . dci harry is another character in this series of which i am beginning to warm up to despite some of his obvious flaws . it will be interesting to see how the author develops both characters as the series progresses.griffiths ' writing is not cluttered , and the plot is relatively easy to follow . i love the atmospheric , gothic-feel that permeates the story , which happens to be the main reason why i love this series . i look forward to more of ruth galloway in the future .

> and did i hear a yes song in a strip club ? yes ! that 's all you need to know as far as what to expect- a very different kind of drama , with a *very* subtle touch of comedy ( especially from vincent gallo 's parents who are impolitely hilarious ! ) buffalo '66 is actually an overall solid and wonderful movie.it 's about a man who finally gets out of prison , and he apparently does n't know what to do or where to go , so he kidnaps a woman who just so happens to willingly go along with his every single demand , and the two of them go on an adventure of a lifetime.i can honestly say i 've never seen a movie quite like this . the character played by vincent gallo has parents who are extremely weird , haha . they apparently do n't care about their son even a *little* bit when he shows up to their doorsteps one afternoon and ... well , i really do n't want to spoil the storyline for you . i promise you it 's extremely entertaining though.vincent gallo 's character starts out by forcing the woman he kidnaps to do whatever he says , but christinia ricci 's character is so laidback , nonchalant and just bizarrely quiet that she apparently does n't have a single concern in the world , so she ends up going along with everything with no resistance whatsoever.honestly , the tone of the film is definitely on the serious side above everything else , and the comedic elements are few and far between . that 's what you can expect . a really strange film . got ta love it when film writers go the extra mile to create masterpieces like these !

> an epic journey of intimacy , rejection , betrayal . . . and hopegod gives hosea a difficult command -- marry a prostitute in order to show god 's people the nature and depth of his love for israel . when hosea goes to israel to proclaim the lord 's message , the woman god directs him to marry turns out to be his childhood friend gomer . he finds her broken and abused , unwilling to trust hosea or his god . but when marrying hosea becomes her only means of escape , gomer does what she 's good at -- she survives . can hosea 's love for god and god 's love for israel restore gomer 's broken spirit ? most of us are familiar with the biblical story of hosea and gomer & # 8212 ; and touched by it , in many ways . love in a broken vessel is a biblical fiction based on that true story , and it will bring it to life in a new way.the book starts with a prologue that instantly draws you into the story . a brief scene , showing the when hosea is approached by god with the difficult commandment & # 8211 ; & # 8220 ; go , marry a prostitute & # 8221 ; and the reason why because israel & # 8220 ; has acted like prostitutes and abandoned yahweh. & # 8221 ; it makes for a heart-breaking but eye-opening story for hosea & # 8212 ; and a glimpse into gomer , making us see her for the used , broken vessel she truly was . if you like biblical fiction , then love in a broken vessel is a book you will want to read .

> this is a long book and it did take me awhile to get into it , but once my interest was piqued , then i really enjoyed it . it is quite a bit different than perry 's earlier works and the time frame and location are certainly different . the book is set in byzantium ( which later on in history became the city of constantinople ) in the 13 century . the premise behind the book is the differences in points of view and in religious dogma between the roman catholic church and the greek orthodox church . it is also set around the time of the crusades , so that too is also thrown into the mix . people are fighting for their homeland and their religion and it is a very unsettling and unstable time . i love the way anne perry sets the stage in her books , and even though this one was slower than her other works , the stage was set magnificently . i found that i really got into the time and place and really cared about what happened to anna and her friends . anna is a wonderful heroine - a strong female who is also a doctor and one who cares deeply for the human race . and no one can weave a plot like anne perry ! it is her own particular secret and that is what keeps me turning the pages in every book she writes . i think that this book puts anne perry near the top of the historical novel writers list because she has diverged so much from her regular series , and still has managed to write a book that fascinates and enthralls .

> finally , dracula is put into a serious collection ! here we have not only the original classic dracula ( w/ the incomparable bela lugosi ) , but four more toothy vampire thrillers ! dracula concerns the transylvanian count and his trip to his new digs , where he quickly takes a big bite out of his neighbors . can von helsing stop this evil undead plague , or will dracula win the night ? dracula- the spanish version was filmed simultaniously with bela 's feature . it is quite good on it 's own merit , with actors that took pride in their work . some things are different in nuance as well as some actual ( subtle ) changes to the props , dialogue , action , etc . it 's fun to watch ! dracula 's daughter is about a woman who seeks the aid of a psychiatrist in dealing with her vampirism . can a supernatural curse be broken by scientific / psychological means ? hmmm . son of dracula has lon chaney jr. as the returning nosferatu . posing as count alucard , he terrorizes the countryside ! house of dracula has lon jr. back as the wolfman , looking for a cure for his canine affliction . john carradine is along for the ride as count dracula ( w/ a snappy moustache ) . frankenstein 's monster does n't get much screen time , just sort of lumbering around aimlessly . not a bad monster bash though ! this collection is superb and should be bought before universal re-seals their rusty old vaults once more ...

> french is a fine writer , a master of character and style . her writing is as smooth as irish whiskey and her characters as intriguing as fitzgerald anti-heroes . we face a second literary outing for undercover policewoman cassie maddox , months after the traumatic events of the first novel in the series , in the woods . she is now working domestic violence cases , happy to be rid of undercover work and her old boss frank mackey . but an incredible thing has happened -- a body is found , a young woman who looks exactly like cassie , who is using the identity of cassie 's old undercover alias . mackey talks her into going undercover again and into the life of the victim , to try and identify the murderer . i thoroughly enjoyed this character-driven mystery , though i did n't find it entirely satisfying . there are lovely insightful sketches of the people here , but not much attention is paid to motivation . why do cassie and sam love each other ? why does cassie go against all her training to keep the victim 's secrets ? why does she often disconnect her wire or get drunk ? she 's more messed up than the suspects , but even her recklessness is without passion . still , though the premise is outrageous , this is a jolly ride with spectacular companions as cassie observes the young woman 's roommates and tries not to make a misstep.quite fun .

> the belkin classic tab case for kindle fire hd 7 '' is a decent-quality case that holds the tablet securely with elastic attached to four angled corner pieces . the interior is a gray soft touch material that feels nice in the hand when folded back for use . it 's not designed to prop the kindle up for watching movies but will stay in place against another object.the cover is smooth artificial leather that does n't have the convincing quality feel of the belkin cases with textured artificial leather . it is also more susceptible to scratching and even the magnetic tab dents it.what i do like about this tab version is that the cover has two tones with a two inch-plus strip at the spine . the effect is reminiscent of older books with dual binding materials . the gray version has a black spine with a gray cover while the pink one has a deep pink , almost red spine with a coral-pink cover . both have a bit more contrast than the photos on amazon indicate and would go well with spectator pumps and handbags of the same color.the magnetized tab that keeps it closed works well enough and seems durable . it will also keep the covers together when the front flap is folded all the way back and this may be quite useful if you 're one of those people aggravated by floppy book covers that get in the way .

> good sense anti-diarrheal loperamide hydrochloride tablets , 2 mg , works just as well as imodium a-d but does n't cost as much . this is the type of product you want to buy and had on hand before you need it . i do n't eat beef or pork but when a friend brought over chili with beef in it , forgetting or not caring i do n't eat beer . i wrongly assumed she used ground turkey because we had discussed my dietary restrictions a few days before . well , if you have n't eaten beef in a long time , it tends to cause a distressing digestive tract uproar leading to the dreaded runs . i took this product as directed and it worked just as the name brand product does . i 'm so happy i had these tablets on hand . when you need it , you are n't in any condition to run out to buy it .

> this game is pretty cool for time unused at appointment waiting rooms or to kill 10 minutes here and there . it is not a game one ( at least not me ) can sit at for an hour or two . the goals are achievable - the payouts a little low - making the game purchases ( characters , etc ) a bit of time to obtain . the lack of last star from me is due to fact that purchasing the new characters adds nothing . it seems silly to offer characters for purchase and have them do same thing our original game start dude did / does . the only impetus for getting the expensive characters is for an achieve badge . which is really not incentive enough for me . so , great little time waster /filler - but not really compelling me toward gaming addiction . though , i can see how it would be for many.christine

> `` little century '' tells the story of the small town of century on the high desert of central oregon , as told by 18 year old orphan esther chambers - at the turn of the 20th century . esther has come to century from chicago to live with a distant cousin after the death of her mother.this is an exceptional book , telling esther 's story as she homesteads , full of incredible detail and lyrical prose . it is a story of the range wars between the cattle ranchers and the sheepherders . it is a coming-of-age story . it is a tale of romance and growth and friendship and doing what 's right.keesey 's characters feel full of life , ready to walk right off the page and discuss their everyday life with you.if you likedmy & aacute ; ntoniaorletters from honeyhill : a woman 's view of homesteading , 1914-1931 , you should like esther 's story .

> almost all pilots seem forced . not this one . titus welliver nailed my image of the 43 year old bosch ! i especially enjoyed finally , finally hearing what i assume to be frank morgan and harry 's jazz.the pilot seemed a bit jumpy to my wife who has not read the books but captured or better put gave us some tantalizing glimpses into harry 's mission , dark side , and the city of angels . this stayed true to the novels.it was awesome for someone like me who has only been in la 1 day and walked out into the pacfic ( just to say i have ) to finally see the locations that i have read about for years . what an awesome start that can only get better.dark brooding detective , awesome jazz for music , and shot in la.amazon i do n't know how you can beat this ! give us more !

> the story seems simple but has a complex theme . aliens show up who want to eat the world and , in return , will pay in gold . of course the government gives in . the plot , in other words , is just a delivery system to tell us the facts . we 're losing the planet . much of what we do , from changing light bulbs to recycling , while good is not good enough . we need a total redesign of our culture , our ways of thinking , and we need to value life more than we value air conditioning and fast food . i 'm not sure about using bombs and death rays but we do need to change things now . no , i mean right now . not after you 're dead . funny enough this book very likely killed a tree but what can you do ?

> the first one was the slimmest in the series , and was an excellent introduction to the harry potter universe . however , it is fortunate that the second book is thicker - more good stuff to read . as always , mary grand pre does an excellent job illustrating - it would have been nice if we had full-page illustrations instead of the cute little ones we see on the chapter beginnings.harry potter learns more about history overall - voldemort 's history , his own family history , and the history of the school . his relationship with voldemort is hinted at , but since you know there 's five more books to go , it wo n't be revealed here . still , enough information is given to make for a good story , so kudos for the second installment of harry potter 's story .

> see book description above.from kyle mill 's very first novel , i 've been a fan . the character of mark beamon is a very likeable and admirable hero.the story and characters of mill 's latest are also very timely . from yasin , a powerful afghan terrorist , to volkov , a powerful drug lord . the many characters make for a somewhat intricate plot . afghan terrorists and drug dealers , local mafia bosses , a laotion general , cia bosses , fbi bosses , heroin wars , a missing rocket launcher , and of course mark beamon and his friends.a great international thriller with vivid story telling.highly recommended .
= great thriller

> the first part of the story was kind of slow , and i was continually comparing it to hunger games which started out fairly quickly . but i have to say that you must read on because it is worth the wait . i 'm most of the way through the novel , and it just keeps getting better and better . exciting world that roth has created , one that could actually happen in an alternate reality .
= started slow but got great
< worth the wait

> reading more like a story of the 30 's than the 60 's , this story dried up half way down the course . a father who performs miracles , a son who becomes an escaped murderer and the north dakota landscape , are not enough to hold interest . detailed prologue to climaxes , that lack detail and are no more than summaries of action , dilute an interesting effort .

> john travolta , who became famous for his role of vinnie barbarino on the abc sitcom & quot ; welcome back kotter & quot ; , had two prior megahit starring films , & quot ; saturday night fever & quot ; and & quot ; grease & quot ; . in his third megahit , this film , he is beauford uan & quot ; bud & quot ; davis , an urban cowboy who moves to houston from spur , a small houston suburb . he lands a job at an oil refinery where his uncle bob works . debra winger is sissy , who bud met at gilley 's , the real-life pasadena , tx honky tonk . bud and sissy fall in love and get married at the hot nightspot . scott glenn is wes hightower , a paroled convict who steals sissy 's heart and keeps it while she and bud are separated and nearly divorce . madolyn smith in her debut , at least on the big screen , is pam who is bud 's girlfriend during the separation . country singer mickey gilley owns the nightspot with sherwood cryer ( both appear as themselves in the film ) . in addition to gilley , country artists appearing in the film are bonnie raitt , johnny lee and the charlie daniels band . all four artists have contributed to the soundtrack album . this film was directed by the late james bridges , whose prior films include september 30,1955 and the china syndrome . bridges subsequently directed mike 's murder also starring winger , perfect , also starring travolta , and bright lights , big city starring michael j. fox . sadly , gilley 's was burned down in 1989 by a kitchen fire and was later re-christened as gilley 's mechanical bull & amp ; nightclub . travolta would have no megahit films following this one until 1989 's look who 's talking . he won an oscar for his role in 1994 's pulp fiction and is still going strong in hollywood today .

> a lot of the reviews seem to focus on what this book is not . it is n't really a shopping guide ( there is no information on where to find the specific pieces pictured , which can be mildly frustrating ) and it is n't a guide to dressing to flatter your shape . the authors seem to assume that you already know how to do that or can find that information in another book.but what this book does do is provide a fun and inspiring look at ten different `` iconic looks '' ( like bohemian , american classic , bombshell , or california classic ) . you 'll get pictures of famous women who embody that look and brief interviews with `` real women '' who wear the look . there are also lists of `` essential '' pieces for the look . this was my favorite part of the book , but it is also where common sense comes in . if there is a suggestion for a specific piece that you know wo n't flatter you , then modify it.this is a useful read for somebody who knows what she likes but may not be quite sure how to spin it into a coherent look , or even somebody who knows her look but is looking for new ideas . it does assume that you already know the basics of how to shop and find things that flatter your figure and are age-appropriate . the women pictured are thinner and more beautiful than the average american , but since this was published by a magazine that features models who are thinner and more beautiful than the average american , i did n't feel that was inappropriate .

> shot in just over 300 days , mostly in ireland , stanley kubrick 's 1975 adaptation of william makepeace thackery 's picaresque 1844 novel is as other-worldly as 2001 : a space odyssy . somewhat dismissed when it was first released , it now holds a far more respected place in the best 100 lists of film critics and film fans . martin scorsese names it as his favorite kubrick film . it certainly is mine . the story is about how irish lad redmond barry became english nobleman barry lyndon . but it 's not so much the plot or the episodic adventure as it is the world in which it unfolds.kubrick wanted the film to be as perfect a mirror of its 18th century setting as possible . he studied the landscape paintings of the era , especially those watteau and gainsborough . he is said to have special camera lenses ground that could photograph natural lighting not only on exterior locations but also interior sets lit by candles to better evoke the era.the resulting film , now transferred to blu-ray , is exquisite . john alcott 's extraordinary cinematography must be seen on a big hi-def display to fully appreciate this vivid , eerie , ethereal , lucid dream of a movie that only gets better with age and repeated viewings . the disc has no extras . it would be nice , but the movie is more than enough.gaze into this shimmering mirror of another time and place . it will take you away ...

> emerson lake & palmer / welcome back my friends to the show that never ends : the only way to really appreciate this groups live output is through a nearly complete reproduction of their concert . this is what the original 3 lp release did back in 1974 , and it is here available in this 2 cd version . clearly , elp approaches rock through the doors of classical training and jazz influences , which is just as legitimate as it is to come to it through blues or country . elp was one of the best , and most interesting , bands of the 1970 's and this album is a true gem . of course , the punk rockers liked to point to the ` over pretentious ' groups like elp as being the reason for returning to their garage band styles . well , that was fine . i liked the punk movement . however , the sloppy fun of the punks did not make the precise beauty of the progressive groups obsolete . as to being ` pretentious ' , they are no more or less pretentious than any other group that makes beautiful and memorable music ( in there own way ) . the one who hates classical orchestration is no more a music lover than the one who hates the grateful dead 's drawn out improvisations . good music is good music , and the elp live set is excellent music . five stars .

> dean corll , a gay rapist and predator was responsible for the deaths of between 20-30 boys in the houston area ( a houston neighborhood called `` the heights '' was his major hunting grounds ) during the early 1970s.corll , a worker in a candy factory used candy and promises of fishing trips to lure adolescent boys into his shop . once he gained access to the boys , he chained them to a piece of plywood and subjected them to sundry atrocities before killing them . he prided himself on being a traveling mortician ; he buried most of the boys in a shed nowhere near his property . others were buried in secluded spots.corll 's sick , twisted career is believed to have started in 1970 with the disappearance and subsequent deaths of jerry and donald waldrup . between 1970-1973 some 25 boys were discovered to have been killed by corll . two young men , elmer wayne henley , jr. and david brooks were used to procure the boys for corll . the depraved candy man even bought david a car for his efforts.matters came to a head when henley allegedly shot corll to death during the summer of 1973. he claimed he shot the man in self defense . he and brooks are currently serving time for their involvement with the candy man .

> as someone whose main stock of hangers come from the ones received from the dry cleaners , these are a huge step up ! they are very durable -- the frame is thick and solid , and retain their shape even when bent ( e.g. , you can bend it , and it spring back to the original shape ) . the hooks are solidly anchored into the frame and are made of thick wire.the overall design is more stylish than the typical hanger , with a heart design incorporated into the top of the hanger right under the hook . it adds both to the looks and the functionality , since you can put a belt ( or a scarf ) though the heart.the frame is covered with flocking ( basically a velvet-like coating ) that keeps a good grip on clothes . the downside is that you ca n't pull a pair of pants off the hanger without the hanger coming along for the ride . but , on the plus side , pants stay put when they are on the hanger.the only negative is a minor one -- the hooks are fixed , so they ca n't be swiveled while on the pole.i 'm very pleased with these -- durable and functional .

> when gp started publication there was n't anything else to compete with it . now the aspiring youg guitarist has his or her pick of guitar mags , full of tab transcriptions of the latest hits and fawning interviews with pretentious guitar heros.gp has tried to stand out form these magazine by being more about music and equipment , and to have a broader view of guitar playing , and to an extent is has succeeded . you 're far more likely to find a profile of an intersting flamenco or brazilian guitarist in gp than in one of the other mags , and while you wo n't find fully tabbed out songs , gp is far more likely to deliver an article that goes into some depth on theory and application . in that sense , gp is more for musicians , and the other guitar magazines are mostly for teens looking to cover their favorite bands.gp is n't always great . some issues are completely devoid of anything that interests me , and there 's far too much punk and shred guitar for my tastes . but a subscription is ridiculously cheap ; i do n't mind if i only find something of use in as few as half the issues i receive .

> i think i originally bought this to weigh yarn ( i spin and knit ) but i have found dozens of other uses for it : weighing mushrooms when we go foraging , dividing ground meat for burgers , dividing pie dough to make a two-crust pie , weighing ingredients for making soap , weighing ingredients for cooking ( more accurate than measuring in a volumetric cup ) , weighing salt to make brine solutions for meats , and now i decided to keep track of calories , and it 's awesome for that . do you ever buy a package of sliced cheese and read the nutritional information on the package ? it says one ounce of cheese has about 100 calories in it , but it how much does the slice weigh ? is it an ounce , half ounce ? anyway , i find this scale very useful and it has been working fine without issue for many months . i am glad i bought it.update 8/9/2013 : i have used this scale every day and i have n't change the battery yet ! the scale is still working fine and i am so glad i bought it

> i take several nutritional supplements , with some of them for their general anti-oxidant properties , the rest for anti-inflammatory action for osteoarthritis pain relief . because of kidney issues , my doctor has recommended that i stop taking nsaids . the supplements that i 've been taking , including omega-3 fish oil , quercetin , and sam-e have all helped with arthritis pain relief , enough to make the pain bearable , but after reading about the possible benefits of curcumin on joint health , i decided to try it for that reason , in addition to the other benefits claimed for curcumin.the results have been promising , and i have n't had any noticeable adverse side effects . at my age ( approaching 70 ) , i think that it 's a sensible precaution to take supplements like curcumin to help ward off diseases and physical ailments that accompany aging . as for the brand , our local health food store , a large independent , began carrying the full line of jarrow products last year , and the salespeople recommend them , so i use several jarrow products now , including curcumin 95 .

> this is not the mark twain that you may remember from early works such asthe celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county . this is twain at the end of his life -- angry , unable to suffer hypocrites , annoyed at the compromises that blind allegiance to religion forces on our humanity , frustrated , bitter . all these emotions come shining through in the work and it is an intense read.the story is accessable and interesting . twain is n't at his best when he 's trying to create non-contemporary environments ( as he does in this story ) , but you probably are n't reading him to understand medieval austria better anyway.the ending in this version comes out of nowhere and is n't particularly well done . since he was n't around to finish this ( and i do n't think this is even the most widely accepted ending ) , i 'm not going to fault the book for that.as a glimpse into twain 's articulate and righteous anger about the dumb and cruel things we humans do to each other ( and to animals ) , this book is well worth reading .
= angry and passionate twain

> i wanted a spare charging cable for my samsung galaxy note 3 phone and took a chance on this one . by that i mean that that other usb 3.0 cables that i have tried with the phone would charge it , but would not support full speed data transfers and synching . this one performed without issues and identically to my oem samsung cable that came with my phone.the blue outer jacket is much thicker than the samsung cable . although it is slightly stiffer it 's also pliable and easy to bend and coil . part of the reason for the extra thickness is probably from the the foil and braid shielding . in fact , the shielding is one factor in this cable 's ability to transmit data at such high speeds without error . another factor is the gold plated connectors.the bottom line is this cable seems to be the equal of the more expensive samsung oem cable . in my experience anyway . i have owned it for three months and it has been problem free in every respect .
= as good as the oem cable that shipped with my note 3
< works great with samsung galaxy note 3

> finding wipes that do n't contain the stench of talcum is a godsend . i ca n't stand the smell of talcum powder and coming across unscented wipes is a refreshing change of pace . i am a fan of this product and can attest to its gentle touch on baby skin.these wipes are moist and do n't contain a lot of skin-irritating chemicals that many other wipes , particularly the scented ones do . you can even order a case of refills at amazon ! this product is ideal for babies and , in talking with a nurse , also for nursing staff who clean patients . it is an equal opportunity gentle touch product.as for the extra cases that you get each time you order a refill , you can recycle the cases . others have made the good suggestion of restocking the refills so as to cut down on extra plastic . other than that , i have only praise for this product .

> upon viewing the first chapter , it 's obvious that `` batman and robin '' ( 1949 ) will not emerge as one of the all-time great serials . with producer sam katzman at the helm , it 's bargain-basement all the way - right down to the cheap costumes and an incredibly poor excuse for a batmobile . despite low-budget shortcomings , there 's plenty of hokey fun as batman and robin face one contrived cliffhanger after another . the mysterious wizard makes for an interesting villain , since he never appeared in the comic books . robert lowery does a good job as batman , but john duncan 's boy wonder looks like a juvenile delinquent . it 's nice to see character actor lyle talbot as commissioner gordon , even though he has a tendency to activate the bat signal in broad daylight . flaws and all , `` batman and robin '' is a guilty pleasure .

> the bottom line : one of those 80s teen films that was never really that good in the first place but people all pretend is a classic , weird science is a film designed for 12 year old boys ( and i do n't mean that pejoratively ) who will no doubt find its wish-fulfillment-loaded plot interesting instead of rather juvenile ; parts of the movie are cute and made me fondly remember the days where seeing the naked female form and impressing kids in school were numbers 1 and 2 on my priority list , but nostalgia aside the film is rather mediocre.2.5/4

> in 1997 , nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry . the nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a cd-rom gaming system was able to do , a cartridged based gaming system could do better . that june , the case really proved the theory with the release of starfox 64. the game was the very first to incorporate nintendo 's rumple pak , a force-feedback device that let 's players feel each and every vibration at hand.in the game , you play fox mccloud , a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy andross , a inane , mad genius that demands full control of the lylat system . there are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game , alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to andross . the graphics are so realistic and full of promise , that you see the game so vividly , you feel like you 're a part of it . in starfox 64 , you also have the use of 3 different vehicles , depending on your course , arwing , landmaster tank , or the blue marine sub , only used in the aquas sea level . the game also has a fierce battle level , for up to 4 players , where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders , peppy , falco , and slippy.it took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game , the exact same way nintendo did with starfox 64. the game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat . while nintendo stopped releasing the rumble pak with the game nearly six months later , starfox 64 is still truly a nintendo gamer 's paradise .

> this is a book that made me wish i 'd just stuck with the movie . no one can doubt marcus luttrell 's courage , but over and over , he returns to a simple-minded political premise that 'all the liberals back home ' were to blame for the oversensitive rules of engagement that compromised operation redwing and brought about his ordeal and the deaths of his seal comrades . in fact , many hands -- including the bush administration 's -- developed the roe that led luttrell 's team to free unarmed afghani goatherds who 'd discovered them , perhaps alerting a nearby taliban force . but it becomes evident in reading this book that operation redwing was compromised before it ever started . the terrain into which the seal team was inserted simply was untenable for the mission . this should 've been determined well before lift-off . additionally , the taliban may well have been very aware of the team 's presence long before the the goatherds came upon them . we 'll never really know , yet luttrell makes clear the afghan goatherds plainly deserved to die while he and his comrades deserved to live . this should 've been the prevailing philosophy here and on any other seal mission . ultimately , the luttrell and the team fought heroically . tragically -- and this was indeed a tragic mission -- mike murphy , danny dietz , matt axleson died heroically , as did many others when a helicopter sent into rescue the team was hit by an rpg . it 's anyone 's guess as to how all those decisions came about .

> osama bin laden 's death and the press surrounding the heroic navy seals made me want to learn more about the seals.i spent some time on amazon noodling around various titles and ordered marcus luttrell 's acclaimed memoir lone survivor.this book does.not.stop . the last time i read a book with this much tension and action wasendurance : shackleton 's incredible voyageanother incredible adventure book.marcus luttrell is a member of the elite seals . this book successfully travels between his early years , his training and the fateful afghanistan mission the encompasses the bulk of the book . normally a book that flips between past and present feels awkward and breaks the spell . not in this case . the training of the seals is almost as riveting as the mission . i considered his description of hell week as essential to comprehending his ability to survive the mission in afghanistan.this book will break your heart . this book will make you rethink rules of engagement and make you wonder about human decency . truly the best and worst of both are on full display here.if you chose to read this book about a marcus luttrell a modern hero , you can also learn more about his journey since he returned home . i was compelled to read about him on wikipedia and he accepted my friend invitation on facebook ( he will accept yours too , i 'm no one special ) . mr. luttrell clearly feels a responsibility to honor his friends , i admire him and enjoy following his work going forward .

> murder on the flying scotsman by carola dunn is the fourth book in the daisy dalrymple series . daisy is on the flying scotsman train on her way to scotland to write a magazine article about an estate up there , when she discovers that belinda fletcher , the daughter of scotland yard investigator alec fletcher has stowed aboard to be with her . alec and daisy have been developing a relationship over the previous books that has n't quite crossed the line from friendship into romance , although belinda has high hopes . while aboard the train , daisy and belinda both get caught up in the drama of the mcgowan family who are all traveling up north in hopes of changing the family patriarch 's mind about his will . when the presumed heir turns up dead , daisy calls upon alec to investigate and help to determine just why belinda is fearful of going to jail herself . i 'm a big fan of cozy mysteries , and dunn writing is perfect for this genre . she creates a intricate plot , with enough clues for the reader to make their own guesses , includes lots of interesting historical detail , and pokes gentle fun at mysteries for a touch of humor . dunn writes a breezy and enjoyable historical mystery , and daisy is a dandy heroine .

> olena day has paid her dues and worked hard . as a result , she 's a successful businesswoman . however , her personal life has suffered . at 43 , she 's single , without children , does n't have any friends , nor has she accomplished her dream of writing a novel . determined to write a novel , she takes a year off . it 's during that time that she meets possible suitors jason and matthew . each man has his own pros and cons ( age being a big con ) and olena is attracted to both for different reasons . can she handle being in love with a younger man ? i was skeptical at first as this novel started off extremely slow and did n't really have my complete interest . olena was extremely uptight , which made it hard to attach to the story . but as i continued reading , it became better ... much better , especially after matthew and jason appeared on the scene . at this point i was totally intrigued . i absolutely hated the way `` in love with a younger man '' ended , though . i could n't believe that cheryl robinson left the novel the way she did . i 'm very excited to read the continued novel to see the outcome .

> the screen on my pc gets somewhat cruddy because i have my morning coffee and most of my meals in front of the pc . coupled with the normal accumulation of dust and the fact that it is a touch-screen there are plenty of finger prints and other materials to clean . when the eraser arrived i was anxious to give it a try . the results are as follows : good : made in the usa . kudos to bestiproducts.com of edgewater fl.part of cost donated to very worthy causes.cleans dust and some fingeprints.looks good and is easy to use.debris collected on eraser is easily removed with light brushing.not so good : does not remove any debris that has hardened on the screen.does not remove all fingerprints.had to run down to the dollar tree and pick up some awesome orange to clean what the eraser left behind.i really hate to give this outstanding company only three stars but in all my reviews i strive for honesty . regardless of the rating i plan to purchase additional units to give to relatives and friends .

> it 's difficult for me to express how much i loved this novel and i am pretty hard to impress.dobson created a world that was fascinating and filled it with characters to match . it was the rare type of book that i would read on my commute and find myself thinking about all day until i got a chance to read it again . it felt much too short -- the story wrapped up , but i wish it could have gone on and on.the common perils of fantasy novels -- information dumping , impossibly perfect characters , meaningless details -- dobson avoids all of these . he uses a fantasy setting to tell a tale of heroism , the importance of knowledge , and redemption.books like this are the reason to read independently published books . i ca n't wait to read dobson 's short story and i hope his second book is out soon .

> i absolutely love the amelia peabody series , and i 'm finding that the books just keep getting better and better . this particular book is quite spectacular ! i 'm sure that it 's the characters that keep me coming back each time , but i 'm never disappointed with the stories either . ms. peters is a real grand-master in the writing field , and i hope she keeps this remarkable family going for a long time to come . the setting in this book is in around luxor and in the valley of the kings . the emersons come into possession of a very valuable statue that appears to have a curse on it . emerson and peabody are committed to finding where the statue came from , and while they continue their search there are numerous undesirable people after it and the emersons themselves . just another rollicking good time !

> scott turow is just simply an outstanding legal thriller author , and , imo , this is still his best . it 's ambiguous , sneaky , freaky , scary , and realy believable . a lovely and very seductive lawyer is murdered , and it becomes clear she 's been having an affair . then , much to his amazement , damning evidence points to the prosecuting attorney ( played awfully well by harrison ford ) as the prime suspect , esp when his superior ( and a possible other suspect ) sets him up for the fall.and then there 's ford 's odd possibly mentally ill wife ... super good all the way through , and it 'll keep you guessing as long as you do n't read any reviews that give it away .

> i got this movie because i like the work cuba gooding jr. and christian slater , both fine actors , who did what they could with this rather flat take on the `` war of drugs '' film . the story was a predictable good guy vs. bad guy film , with a suffering cop out for revenge , so do n't expect any groundbreaking story telling . it 's an enjoyable enough movie to watch , with some nice action , and the bad guy getting what he deserves in the end .

> & quot ; popart & quot ; is the video anthology of pet shop boys . it compiles all 38 of their videos ( as well as extended versions of 3 videos ) on a single dvd . when viewed from start to finish , the dvd runs for nearly three hours . while most pop acts release great singles but inferior videos , neil tennant and chris lowe have crafted music clips that are just as elegant as the albums they release . & quot ; popart & quot ; the dvd runs the gamut of moods and flavors , from the tasteful ( bruce weber 's black-and-white & quot ; being boring & quot ; ) , the homoerotic ( & quot ; domino dancing & quot ; and & quot ; paninaro 95 & quot ; ) to high-tech ( & quot ; can you forgive her ? & quot ; and & quot ; liberation & quot ; ) , to the violent ( & quot ; jealousy & quot ; ) and the silly ( & quot ; heart , & quot ; which has an appearance by sir ian mckellan ) . even better , the videos are remastered , featuring picture quality ranging from good to striking . the music is also presented in a full-bodied 2.0 channel surround sound . sure , i would have liked to have seen these videos in 5.1 audio , but the 2.0 sound quality is so superior that i did n't care . you can also watch these videos individually , in random order , or in a continuous sequence . there is n't much to boast in the way of extras , although there is a running commentary by neil , chris , and journalist chris heath . these guys are very laid back and have a real ball poking fun at each other and at the videos they made . the dvd also comes with a booklet that contains production credits and various pictures of the music videos . for american listeners who ca n't catch all these clips on mtv , this dvd is a real treat and a must-own . one final note : & quot ; popart & quot ; does n't have videos for either 2003 's & quot ; miracles & quot ; or & quot ; flamboyant , & quot ; but other than that , this covers the groups entire visual history .

> backstreet boys broke big in europe and asia before they finally broke the us market . their debut album was released internationally in 1996 , but it would take another year before it was released in the us . nevertheless , it is amazing to me that it 's been 15 years since this was released . `` backstreet boys '' ( 12 tracks ; 52 min . ) starts with an incredible infectious `` we 've got it going on '' , what an opening track ! it is followed by the pleasant mid-tempo `` quit playing games with my heart '' and the ballad `` as long as you love me '' . but then things get even better with the rebel-rousing `` everybody ( backstreet 's back ) '' , the best track on here , and the best bsb track ever , period . not that bsb was away as this was their first album , but hey , who 's minding . great tracks follow one after another , such as the pensive `` all i have to give '' , and the dance-alongs `` hey mr. dj ( keep playin ' this song ) '' and `` get down ( you 're the one for me ) '' , but truth be told , there are no weak tracks on here and sounds like a greatest hits album.15 years on , this album stands the test of time , and it is amazing to me how fresh it still sounds ( compared to say , the spice girls a few years later , who now sound very dated ) . this is the best bsb album period . i saw the bsb in concert once in 1999 , at the peak of the bsb/*nsync boy band craze ( i went on a date , to be honest ) , and what a great show it was . meanwhile , this album was and is a major musical guilty pleasure .

> i 've often wondered why no popular `` hair metal '' band from the 80 's has been able to put out an album since then that is anywhere near as good as their older material . some bands , cinderella for example , have opted not to release any new material at all . other bands , like poison and dokken , released such sub-par albums that you wish they had followed cinderella 's example . tesla tried their hand at a comeback album with 2004 's into the now , their first new album in a decade.tesla has always been better than most of their peers , and probably should n't have been lumped in with the aqua-net crowd in the first place . so if anyone would be able to release a superior album in modern times , it would be tesla . into the now is everything you could have hoped for . it contains all of the key elements that made tesla great - jeff kieth 's scratchy vocals , frank hannon and tommy skeoch 's bluesy guitars , and lyrics that were always smarter than the party anthems most other bands recorded . it 's heavy , melodic , smart , and best of all it makes no attempt to sound like an alternative or nu-metal album . there are some nods to modern production technology , but for the most part this is a vintage tesla album . indeed , most of the songs on into the now sound like they could have come off of any of the band 's earlier albums.this album proves once again that tesla is , and always has been , a great hard rock band that does n't let trends affect their music .
= as good as ever ... welcome back , tesla !

> after watching rachel ray use a panini maker on the food network , i knew i wanted to try one , and one of my sisters responded by giving me a gr-1 for my birthday recently . now i wish i had had one years ago . i 'm making paninis for my wife and me 3-4 times a week , and they 're the best sandwiches we 've ever had.i 've tried several kinds of bread , and the only type i had a problem with was a fairly thick french bread . with sliced bread and the thin baguettes , no problem . a thick french or cuban bread tends to slide out from between the griddles when you push down the handle . that 's a small complaint , and i now use only sliced bread or baquettes.it takes about five minutes to warm up ( a green light comes on when it 's at the correct temperature ) , and after that , two sandwiches usually take about 2-3 minutes . they 're good , i mean good , with a nice griddled surface and melted cheese running out.the nonstick surface cleans pretty easily with the plastic tool included with the gr-1 . a metal rim around the base griddle keeps melted cheese from running out onto a counter top.overall , i have no serious complaints . the gr-1 is a well made appliance that will be in our kitchen for many years .

> the item description says : `` aimed for readers age five to ten , bookata 's books allow the users ( parents and children alike ) to change in a few minutes the whole content , from illustrations to text , '' but that does n't appear to be what this is at all . maybe it was created using that program ? fans of carroll 's other work ( unholy cow , a story for demented children ( stories for demented children ) orthe emo bunny that should - a story for demented children ( stories for demented children ) , for example ) wo n't find his quirky humor here -- it 's just a basic picture book about a parent telling a child about his new pet cat and predicting the things they will do together . it 's not an especially fun kindle reading experience -- the text placement is very basic and the drawings do n't add much to the story.given the undercurrents of violence ( tossing a cat off a roof , teasing a cat by pulling at it ) , this is n't the book i 'd use to introduce a child to a new pet .

> a co-worker recommended `` ender 's game '' in 1995 and it did n't make much of an impression on me . i could n't `` buy the premise , buy the bit '' , probably because i was n't married with children at that time.recently , i was looking for something to read and i noticed that the book had been revised . i had read quite a few favorable reviews , and i really liked `` pastwatch '' , so i began to wonder if i had missed something when i originally read the book.my daughter had been in a robotics program at school and i was amazed at the technical level that these kids were compared to my own childhood . when i read ender 's game again , i realized that recruiting children to fight a war was totally realistic . if you have an attention span lasting for more that 20 seconds , the book is not wordy , awful , or vague as some reviewers have stated . most likely , these readers prefer the dumbed down writing style of dan brown , which is more suited for the average reader .

> i sleep on airplanes and love the neck support pillows ( kind of ) . why only kind of ? because i have to find a way to carry them with me . i have used several - the buckwheat , the foam , even the blow up kind ( ugh ) .except for the blow up kind ( which are plastic and uncomfortable since i can never get them right ) , these are a pain to carry with me , and i have actually lost several at airports . i ca n't help but wonder how many security alarms i have raised after my plane has taken off when someone sees an unaccompanied pillow sitting there ! so , when aeris offered me a complimentary sample to test for a review , i jumped at the chance ! perhaps i could save at least one airport from blowing up a pillow ! to start out with , it is memory foam and very comfortable . for me it was perfect as i leaned back in my recliner - i almost fell asleep testing it . the memory foam earplugs are fine - they fit easily into my ears . but where it shines is that it squeezes down and fits into the portable bag . it uses a string closure ( like a hoodie ) and you can use those to attach it or it also has a velcro strap to hold it onto a piece of luggage of your choice ( or even your backpack ! ) .comfortable , very comfortable , portable and easy to carry , and with ear plugs . no more setting off alarms by leaving my pillow behind at the airport . tsa is going to love this one.i give it five stars - now go away , i want to lean back and take a nap ! ( slips ear plugs in and leans back ) zzzzz
= zzzzz - that comfortable

> this is my 3rd roku , but first roku 2. i got this one for my office , as i 've already got two other roku boxes , i thought i 'd get the basic roku 2 to stream video on an hd computer monitor while i work . as with the first two roku boxes , set-up was a snap.what i really like about the roku 2 is it 's much smaller footprint . this thing is tiny and fits under the monitor i hooked it up to . you do n't even notice the unit . though this unit is only 720p hd the picture output looks great.i 'm able to stream my amazon on demand , netflix , and the twit channel , pandora , flickr , as well as many others.i 've been so impressed with the roku boxes that i 've recommended them to co-workers , and they just love them.this unit is very basic ... . a small wireless unit , with hdmi or av out . simple ! that 's what i love about it . it also has a micro sd slot , which i have n't used yet.i 'm a bit of a tech geek , and roku has changed my life ... . no more cable for me , and i love that.make sure you get the unit that best fits your needs ... . they have three different units . there is a basic unit ( this one ) , mid-range , and high end ... . all at very reasonable prices.if you love things that are well thought out , and simple and easy to use , i think you 'll really like the roku 2 .

> just ordered & received this kindle the other day and i love it . here are my thoughts : pros : * i know the review is not supposed to be affected by cost but at this cost you could by this as a spare kindle to keep at work or even in the car ! it 's that small and cheap ! * despite it 's small size , it 's very well made and the button placement and controls are easy to use . * love the smaller size , the viewing area is the same as my k3 but without the keyboard i can slip this in my pocket and always have it with me . having such a lightweight and small kindle means you never have to be without it . * the 5 way nav button is very well laid out and using the on screen keyboard is no problem for me . i rarely do anything but read on my kindle so i really do n't need a full keyboard . * i love the special offers ! there are some great deals plus the screen saver never gets old . * it came already registered and i transfered my ebooks over easy.cons : due to the very small size and thinness , i am having a little hard time figuring out how to hold this best for one handed reading . maybe my hands are too large but there does n't seem to be a naturally easy way to hold it and turn the pages with one hand .
= an `` excellent '' basic or 2nd kindle !

> boo ( anthony c. ferrante , 2005 ) anthony ferrante 's feature-length debut , boo , is not entirely horrible . i 'm not sure why this surprised me as much as it did -- perhaps because i have seen so very , very many movies that have this same framework and are , in fact , just that horrible . do n't get me wrong , this is not deathless cinema by any means , but for what it is , you might as well give it a chance.you 've seen it a million times : halloween night , supposedly haunted building , bunch of college kids . you can narrow the derivation down with the one who goes beforehand to put together some tricks to scare the rubes and then mysteriously disappears ( hell night , anyone ? ) . ferrante ( who also scripted ) adds a cop and his friend , whose sister disappeared in said haunted edifice the week before , to the mix.the usual platitudes about low-budget modern horror flicks all go here : acting is n't all that great , script is n't all that great , effects are seriously cheesy , etc . but the surprising flip side , where this movie is concerned , is that while all those things are n't wonderful , they 're actually not all that bad , either . compared to something like hallow 's end or any of the seemingly endless string of pumpkinhead sequels , this is well worth a look . **
= far better than i expected it to be .
< not bad , but not great .

> truthfully , i wanted more than 13 episodes from this emmy award winning show . the ben stiller show featured ben stiller who was up and coming along with janeane garofalo , andy dick , and others . it was an only a thirty minutes show on television once a week . it would be shot in los angeles or hollywood . he would bring on guest stars like rob morrow , dick van patten , and others . the spoofs were hilarious and even better than saturday night live . for example , he plays bono with the guy who managed the partridge family . i love when he sings one in order to sell lucky charms cereal . i love the spoof of a woody allen film where woody 's character is a mummy , mia farrow 's character is the bride of frankenstein , and the plot is similar to the film , crimes and misdemeanors . the cast and crew of this show was first rate and this dvd version also has subtitles in french and spanish . i loved the show going on location in hollywood . this show really marked ben stiller 's great talent and humor as well as his talent as a great satirist spoofing everybody from tom cruise to bono to the kid from the munsters . it was a great show and thank god , that the show is finally on dvd so we can preserve it for years to come .

> ok , it 's not so magic , but the dishes i have created with this one pan have been nothing short of great . healthy too . you can really do some great things with one cast iron skillet like this . it really works well with a minimalist style of cooking , and a bachelor lifestyle overall . haha.. even when cooking for others , this pan has been a great tool in making awesome meals . i picked up a cook book for 'cast-iron ' cooking , and have used it a couple of times , but mostly i have just created some very good stews and stir frys on the fly . everything from egg fried brown rice and vegetables , to a veggie saute with quinoa , to pork chops in a balsamic glaze.. it was all done in one pot , with minimal cleanup and really excellent results.my only recommendation , because i had n't thought of it until after i ordered the skillet ... pick up a lid for it , maybe even two . one glass lid and one cast iron lid for using in the oven.. and dont forget oven mits . even on the range top this guy gets nice and hot , which is why everything cooks so evenly and wonderfully . i hope you enjoy yours as much as i enjoy mine .

> i bought this for a summer house that has an open floor plan on the main level . while we have air conditioning , we only use it during the hot and humid dog days of summer because the house is shaded and is by the lake . this dyson does a nice job of multiplying the air flow and keeping the house cool and comfortable on the days we open the main floor up.due to its size and its pedestal design this fan covers a kitchen , dining area , and large family room effectively . unlike a traditional fan , it has no blades which have the potential to hurt or maim people . it cleans easily with a damp cloth . it can be adjusted for air flow and is not limited to preset speeds so you are never going to get hit with a gust of air . it pivots to cover the entire area . it also has a remote control so you can adjust it anywhere in the room . while it wo n't take care of extreme humidity , it does a nice job on balmy days with moderate humidity.while i am not crazy about the price , i took some of the sting out of this purchase by buying it during a promotional sale that sliced about $ 50 off the price .
= effective and safe
< great for summer house

> it 's not usual for a book to have no real `` heroes '' in it . at least not the upstanding , moral heroes we 're used to in thrillers . with `` void moon , '' michael connelly gives us cassie black , a casino robber par excellence , who finds herself in jail for manslaughter on a hit that went terribly wrong , and cost her the life of her lover , and as the reader finds , even more . cassie then finds herself lured back into one more crime so that she can start a new life . of course , that 's not always so easy . from start to finish , this is an exceptionally riveting and brutal exercise in crime . so even though cassie is not the most `` moral '' of heroines , she is someone you root for and admire for what she does.the main villain , jack karch , rivals gary soneji ( from james patterson 's books ) as one of the most vile and disgusting killers in modern fiction . there are some really brutal scenes in this book , but they are depicted with such ferocity , you can feel the visceral impact.the concept of the `` void moon '' is also eerily employed in striking fashion.this is a highly recommended book .
= do n't avoid this moon
< a book to have no real `` heroes ''

> jan brett has some of the most beautifully illustrated books around . this is no exception.nikki is a boy who convinces baba to knit him some mittens that are as white as snow . baba warns him that white mittens are very easy to lose . baba is right.nikki goes out to play and almost immediately drops one of the mittens . this is where the two stories come in . the main story is told in the large illustrations on each page as a series of animals squeeze themselves into the mitten . in the borders of each page , we see nikki as he plays and ultimately disturbs each of the animals so that they leave their homes and eventually find the mitten.the stories cross as a sneeze blasts the animals out of the mitten and we see nikki retrieve it in the main illustrations while the borders show the animals returning to their homes . baba sees nikki reach up and catch the mitten as it drops from the sky , but she is puzzled when she sees that one mitten is now much larger than the other.absolutely beautiful illustrations . a simple story but full of fun as we see how each of the animals enters the story .
= two stories in one
< a beautiful illustrations

> the good thing about these books is that i actually made it all the way through all three of them ( unlike only getting through one and a half of that vampire/bella book series ) . this is a good dystopic story . my problems with it are first that it did not need to be told in three separate books . book two is a repeat of book one ( with some action in it finally that i kept waiting for the entire first book ) . and second , book three shows beyond a doubt the problems that i already felt in the first parts that collins chose to tell this story from the wrong character 's point of view . the protagonists need to be active in their own destinies , a part of the story , catalysts , etc . a huge part of book three happens without katniss and thus we as readers do n't see it either . this is a case where the movies have the potential to be better than the books because they do not need to stay tied to one pov and can create those missing scenes .
= does no one understand what quality fiction is ?
< good dystopic story

> reading this page and other reviews has been illuminating . i had no idea that this book was even sort of a sequel to anything and that goes a long way towards explaining why i felt like i was missing so much backstory . although , to be fair , one often feels that way in zelazny novels . one of the things that he was so good at as a writer was dropping the reader into the middle of the action and helping them swim instead of letting them sink.it is n't my favorite zelazny . i am giving it four stars because i do not really believe that the man could write a bad book . there were some hackneyed bits but there were also some really lovely moments -- black is a classic character and i really enjoyed him.so . pick this up if you have read the first book which i have not read -- i guess i would look for dilvish the damned first , since this may make more sense . there are probably better places to start with rz if you are new to his work .
= toto , i do n't think that we are in amber any more .

> until i got this mira kitchen scale , i had a postal scale that doubled as a kitchen scale . this mira scale is so wonderful , that i now have a kitchen scale that doubles as a postal scale.right away , i knew i 'd like it . it is small and attractive , with a platform big enough to put a bowl on top . it has a tare function , so i do n't need to calculate a thing . the surface is glass , making cleanup a breeze.the scale measures in grams , pounds and ounces , ounces , and milliliters . i was intrigued by the volume measurement , so i used a syringe with 5 ml of water to see what came up when i weighed it , and the scale measured 5 ml of water . of course , if you have something other than water , your volume readings may be off.the font is large enough to read easily . the operation is intuitive . it 's accurate . i love it.this product was provided for review by mira brands .

> the story of pi patel his bravery , determination and desire to succeed against all odds is the premise of this modern day classic , and one that deserves to be read by all generations of book lovers.the premise of the book is that life is a story , and this is reiterated with startling clarity throughout yann martel 's prose as he manages to combine a clever use of imagery together with a lyrical narrative . at times reminiscent of rudyard kipling , life of pi is a story of survival at its most basic level . the spiritual voyage of individual belief combined with the power of imagination provides a unique vision which allows the reader to undertake an idealistic journey into the unknown.the story does n't suit everyone , reviews have been divided since it was first published , but it does make a very good book group read as it always encourages lively debate.life of pi has been reissued in light of the recent movie edition , and as such will bring this unusual story to a wider audience .

> `` goodbye for now '' starts out strong but then lags and finally bogs down after the first few short chapters . it 's an odd book and it is not absolutely the finest writing so i started reading it several times over the winter but each time it got pushed aside for something i was more in the mood for.however , i have been keeping it in my reading stack because i hope that one morning this summer , i will wake up early and decide on the spur of the moment to go to the beach . i will read this on the train and then under my umbrella during the long , lazy day . i will finish the last few pages and shake the sand out from between them before the train goes underground heading back into the city . then i will take a long hot shower , eat some ice cream , and then update this review before finally falling asleep with the air conditioner on high.or not !

> the right headphone speaker goes in and out . the headphones fit poorly ; actually drop off my head if i bend over . there is no red light on the headphones to tell you that they are on . neither the distance nor the quality is any better than my old , cheap panasonic ones . if i go into another room ~30-40 feet away especially if there is a wall between the headphones and the transmitter i begin to get hiss and interference . update-lowered star rating-after time you find the tuner and volume control mechanism start to fail-still using them but it is a royal pain . if someone changes settings then you can spend half an hour trying to re-balance the tuner and volume wheels . the only positive note is that my off the shelf rechargeable batteries work fine.update : i could not stand them anymore-i bought new headphone that are working-audio unlimited spk-9110 900mhz wireless stereo headphones ( rechargeable )

> to be honest , it 's more of a 2.5 star book . i honestly think the publisher told martin - look , give us something ! we 've got the hbo now , perfect tie-in yada yada . not his best effort . clunky and about 300 pages too long . please , do n't just give us a bunch of pages edited into a `` book '' . i swear , if i hear , or read , the phrase `` much , and more '' or one of its permutations one more time , i will scream . that phrase appears in the book approximately 8,999 times . i am not sure when the next installment will come out . certainly i wo n't wait another 10 years . at this point , i am not even sure i want to read it .

> a recent survey in newsweek said that there are almost 2.5 billion cell phones in use today ; king 's decision to create a terrifying armageddon certainly hits home then . in cell , whose plot has been summarized in the countless other reviews , king uses the ordinariness of our human lives to envision a horrific vision of what could happen if such a thing as the pulse could occur . it 's reminiscent of the stand in that it brings together a wide variety of characters heading for the same destination -- -at first . it also marks king 's return to the horror genre that made him so famous today . cell is also one of king 's goriest works in years , and there are some truly frightening scenes in the book that would make great cinematic material . king does well with his characters and as in any king book , no one is safe..the heroes do n't always live . no spoiler here . i wo n't mention who does n't and if you 're a king afficionado , you know he will pull one on you . anyway , cell is not one of king 's best , although it 's darned good ... king neglects to really fulfill the reader 's interest in determining just how the pulse comes about , and his ending certainly leaves room for cell ii . but it almost seems as though king himself could n't come up with an explanation for the pulse , or how to resolve clay 's long journey to find his son . but nevertheless king fans will gobble this up as it once again demonstrates king 's mastery of narrative and characterization .

> the relationship between two women best friends is different than the friendship between two men can ever be . as a man , it is impossible for me to every understand the female friendship , it is simply twoo alien.it seems that the two women share a part of their life in a way men simply do not . there seem to be few , if any , secrets ( men do n't tell each other much of anything ) . there seems to be an emotional bonding that men never reach , perhaps this is part of the female carrying the emotional content of a family.i read this book then from a standpoint different than the female reader . i was wondering if the stories of friendships breaking up would provide any enlightenment . i must say that they did not . perhaps mens lives are just easier . if there is someone you decide that you miss you call then and say `` how about a beer . `` i did find the book to be most interesting as an insight into the depth of feelings that women have regarding friends . this book should be a starting point for a whole bunch of ph.d. theses on using this as a way to better explain certain thought patterns .

> there is no question that kellogg 's has made some really excellent cereals from the past several years . but there have been some cereals that were n't that good like their newest cereal krave . but with the classic raisin bran , it has never lost its taste and quality all these years . they have upped the ante with raisin bran again with their newest edition of the raisin bran family with their raisin bran cinnamon & almond cereal . the taste is quite good , and is delicious with each and every bite . it shows that kellogg 's is n't afraid to add some zest to a already classic cereal . i thought that it was delicious from my first bite , and definitely shows it . you honestly will not be sorry with this cereal . i definitely recommend kellog 's raisin bran cinnamon & almond cereal.price : btaste : b 1/2+overall : b 1/2+

> sergant pepper may have let the world know there was such a spirit as psychadelia , but saucerful of secrets gave psych a body.it is true that there are some syd barret tracks here that go back to his brand of acid eccentricities . but the first track on this , along with the title track and `` set the control 's for the heart of the sun '' used organs , tympanies , and guitar noise improvasations controlled and focused enough to rival hendrix.what amazes here is the almost classical composer 's maturity floyd uses here to create a template for space rock . freek out would seem an apt word here , but it is not : this album has a reason for every use of noise , dissonence and feedbackbands from hawkwind in the 1970s to hovercraft in the 90s owe their careers in spirit if not direct musical influence to saucerful of secrets

> i 've only read 2 stephen king books : the shining , and now doctor sleep . i enjoyed this latest installment of the torrance story , which followed naturally from the shining . we see danny - now dan - as a drunken drifter who finds a home . many of the 1-star reviews complain about the walk down aa lane , but this did n't feel forced , or the author 's personal confession - why would n't a person battling dan 's demons turn to drink & drugs ? in any case , i also felt the element of suspense here was lacking - that there was little danger for our heroes . this did n't stop me from liking the story , but it did stop me from loving it .

> hey , laugh if you will , but this is one of the best albums of the hardcore hippie era , and a still-beloved favorite from my childhood years . these quiet singer-songwriterish tunes are very much in the soft-pop mould of the crosby , stills & amp ; nash ensemble , which was in one of its periodic stages of disintegration when this album was recorded . david crosby and jerry garcia pitch in from song to song , adding a melodic country-ish feel throughout . overall , this is possibly the best of nash 's solo albums , a cohesive , beautiful , heartfelt set of twee counterculture lullabies . the dewy-eyed , tender romanticism of nash 's love songs heightens the painful anguish of the political material , the anthemic & quot ; chicago , & quot ; which served as a harsh postmortem of the chaotic demonstrations at the 1968 democratic convention , and the simpler ( and more powerful ) & quot ; military madness , & quot ; which gains considerable strength from its understated tone . this disc also features some of jerry garcia 's best pedal steel work , particularly on elegaic tunes like & quot ; i used to be a king. & quot ; i could go on and name all the other songs ; in my opinion there is n't a weak tune in the bunch ... if you 're a staunch , sneering , anti-hippie type , i know -- from experience -- that there is little that i can do to convince you that this record is n't just a bunch of stoned-out , goopy-headed pablum . but those of you inclined to be more open-minded may find this disc to be quite rewarding . it 's sugary , but also quite sweet .

> `` the wire '' tracks the decay of a major american city , in this case , baltimore . the third season focuses on the street level struggle between gangsters for control of the drug trade , the desperation of the police to show measureable progress in their fight against narcotics , and the political maneuvering at the highest levels of municipal government . there is much more going on as well in this complex , intelligently scripted series , far too much to touch upon in a brief review.just in case my opening paragraph makes the show sound too cerebral , rest assured that it rests on a foundation of engaging characters and gritty storylines . we have mcnulty ( dominic west ) , the dedicated cop whose personal life is a shambles , stringer bell ( idris elba ) , the ruthless drug lord trying to become a legitimate businessman , bubbles ( andre royo ) , the good-hearted junkie who feeds information to the police , tommy carcetti ( adrien gillen ) , the councilman with designs on the mayor 's seat who struggles with balancing his idealism with political expediency , major `` bunny '' colvin ( robert wisdom ) , whose radical solution to the drug plague will shake the city from top to bottom , and far too many more to list here.if you have n't seen this show before , begin with the first season . i began with this season and i was sometimes confused because of situations or characters that continued from previous seasons . you can still get your bearings and enjoy the show if you are an attentive viewer , but i think it will be more rewarding to watch events unfold in their proper order .

> 1951 's british version of `` a christmas carol '' is perhaps the standard movie edition of the popular charles dickens classic . delivered in crisp black and white , with its focus on the original story and not on special effects , it delivers the haunting message of dickens ' novella in a way that the many subsequent versions do not.alistair sims is superb as scrooge , easily and believably making the transition from grasping miser to a reformed man of christmas spirit . we see ebenezer rise from neglected schoolboy to poor but generous clerk to rich and ambitious businessman to stingy miser before confronting the three christmas spirits who change his life . his transformation is delivered with obvious physical joy , as he capers like a schoolboy and humbles himself to visit his disowned nephew.brian hurst 's direction is direct and brisk , as an excellent cast steps through the story in just 86 minutes , without missing a single key element . the bob crachitt family is especially well-cast , their sequences together fairly hum with genuine family feeling.unlike many of the later versions , this production makes the point that ebenezer scrooge must be frightened into good sense by the three ghosts , not entertained by them . at the same time , the ghosts are presented as the ultimately humane spirits they must be to give scrooge hope for redemption.this movie is highly recommended to fans of a great christmas classic and those looking for a christmas movie that imparts a real message .

> a remake of the 2007 spanish horror film rec , quarantine is a decent bit of pov-style horror that does n't do the whole handheld camera thing as well as one would hope , but does manage to provide some genuine and even surprising scares . dexter 's jennifer carpenter stars as a reporter who , along with her cameraman ( steve harris ) accompany a group of firefighters ( among them jay hernandez and jonathon schaech ) to a dingy old apartment building upon receiving a disturbance call . it is n't long before them and the rest of the apartment 's tenants ( including greg germann and rade serbedzija ) discover something is horribly wrong , and find themselves quarantined and trapped inside the building as the blood starts to flow and the body count rises . while quarantine offers nothing new at all to the genre , it does manage to provide some solid shocks , scares , and nicely done gore effects . the camera work is n't too quease-inducing , but the pov style does n't always manage to work out for the best either , particularly towards the end of the film when a night vision mode gets implemented . still , most of the cast does well ( hernandez in particular is a standout ) , and the ending sequences will have you sitting on the edge of your seat , and in those respects alone , quarantine is worth a look at the very least .

> this is such an attractive case that its physical appearance is enough to sell thousands of these . made of a synthetic material , it has a high end look to it that is artsy in a classic way . the artist/designer has taken her favorite places and used what i can rightly or wrongly describe as a fluid calligraphy font as her design feature . it 's base color is a dark red that makes the font pop.the interior is sort of jazzy , too . lined with a microfiber material that is black , it has a secure pocket to store notes , etc . on the right interior side . the left interior side is reserved for the kindle fire hd . there are four elastic anchors which secure the kindle and keep it put without any slippage . the front cover and the interior lining are stitched securely in place and seems substantial and secure.my only criticisms is that i wish this had more interior padding and had a clasp or belt to keep it secure when it is in a purse or tote . while i have a high impact screen cover to protect it , i 'd like to keep the kindle from any potential marring or scuffing.overall , this would be a five star product if not for the non-existent closure and thin cushion .

> have you ever looked at a photo of yourself either alone or with someone else as a child and then later in life another photo was taken in the same location when you were older ? did you notice the similarities in facial expressions or maybe even clothing if you were going to stage the photograph ? this book is filled with photographs of people . it shows the person as a child and then later in life . the author tried to make sure the details of the first photo were similar to the later photo . if you look closely you will see the similarities in the two photos.you can change your hair , your body , your clothes and location , but you really can not alter the facial changes .it was really entertaining to see what the author had done with his subjects.as you see the photos and read the individual stories , you will gain insight into the families at the time of the original photo . it may give you a chance to recreate some of your favorite family photos with siblings , parents , and other relatives .

> the glorious masterpiece is a true real nightmare . we end to forget the presence of human beings who live in the dark side of the world . browning with all the possible realism , shows us the low corners of the human depravation , somewhat it makes us to reflect around the adequate place where the pretended ugliness of the soul habits : are they or on the contrary the sickness triviality of office mercenaries who get some undeniable profits with the morbid exhibition masked beneath the title of entertaining ? this terrifying vision around of life and times of weird inhabitants of the sideshow world can shock you ; browning does not employ any special effects ; they are real freaks ; so the visual impact is even higher than you may expect . i have not had any other reference of his approach 's horror until the entry of herzog in 1969 with `` even dwarfs started small '' and lately with david lynch 's `` eraser head '' and `` the elephant man . `` not recommended for squeamish .

> george saunders , the very persistent gappers of frip ( villard , 2000 ) saunders ( pastoralia ) and illustrator lane smith ( the stinky cheese man , james and the giant peach ) team up to deliver this cautionary tale about helping your neighbors out of a jam . and while the story wears its moral far too plain on its face , the story itself , and the wonderfully twisted illustrations that accompany it , make it worth a read.capable and her father live in the very small town of frip . it 's so small , in fact , it only has three houses . frip 's whole economy is based on goat 's milk . which is all well and good , except for these odd little amphibians called gappers , who love goats , and shriek with joy when they see a goat . the shrieking makes the goats nervous , and causes them to stop giving milk . so life in frip is a constant battle of keeping the gappers away from the goats.things get nasty when the gappers realize that capable 's house is the closest to the sea , and so they should all lavish their affections on capable 's herd . which makes her neighbors very happy , since their goats are no longer plagued . they refuse to help her with her gappers , and thus the conflict at the center of the book is born.this is exceptionally fun stuff . perhaps having the lane smith illustrations put me more in mind of the late roald dahl than i otherwise would have been , but there is certainly a dahl-esque feeling to saunders ' writing . dahl was usually better at concealing his morals within the context of his stories ( overly-moralizing oompah-loompahs excepted , of course ) , and so i have a hard time ranking saunders with the best of dahl 's work . but it is a fine thing , and quite worth your time . ***

> written in 1971 , this collection of jokes show its age , but carries it well . asimov has collected his favorite jokes that he has encountered over the years and written a few of his own . many of them are true classics , such as the jack benny response to the question , `` your money or your life ! '' some of the funniest were from dorothy parker , such as the time she was lonely in her tiny , out-of-the-way office and wrote men on the door . her usage of the term horticulture in a joke '' you can lead a horticulture but you ca n't make her think '' is in the running for the best wordplay joke i have ever heard.although asimov does include a few dirty jokes , they are at the end of the book and few involve curse words . most of the off-color jokes involve sexual innuendo or wordplay . for example , when the young man takes his wife to the doctor , he is told `` your wife has acute angina '' , to which he replies with pride , `` she certainly does . `` asimov also interjects his explanations of the jokes , sometimes where he heard it and specific details as to how to tell it . if you are someone who wants to be the life of a party without possibly offending anyone present , then most of these jokes will be appropriate . some require a bit of explanation before you will understand the joke , so in those cases it is a good think that asimov provided the commentary.i enjoyed this book having recently reread it for the second time . the jokes are funny , generally not complex and do n't have the hard edge that so many modern jokes are based on .

> i enjoyed this compilation volume of `` wool '' . i found it generally well-written and interesting . i 'm impressed by the quality ; especially given it is a self-published work . well done , mr. howey.i really appreciated the world-building here . i also appreciated the genius of releasing a couple short stories in the `` wool '' universe and expanding on that with later novels . great strategy.that said , i 'm glad i bought the omnibus , because i think i would 've been miffed if i 'd only bought the first story alone thinking it was a full book . but as a full-length novel in five parts , the `` wool '' omnibus works quite well . it does n't have the standard slow rise until the climax that most novels have , but the final climax is big enough , and the world and characters interesting enough , that it does n't particularly matter . think of this more as a `` martian chronicles '' work , where five individual stories paint a larger narrative and together explore a world.all the stories in the omnibus are brooding , character-based stories , by the way . so if you 're looking for non-stop `` star wars '' action , this is n't the place.still , `` wool '' is a good addition to the sci-fi genre . my only criticism would be the sparse character and place description in the first couple books . description is important . the more foreign the place , the more description a reader needs to `` see '' it.all in all this is a fun series , though . i recommend it.and do n't bother buying individually . just spring the five bucks for the omnibus . it is worth it .
= a good addition to the genre .

> i loved this series ! i was intrigued when it first came out , but i 'm glad i waited to read the episodes all at once . waiting would have killed me . there was a whole lot of description of the stairs in the silo in just the first few pages , but when you take those paragraphs against the whole of the story , it 's so deep and thought-provoking , just like the titles of each segment . what a talented writer . the overall story was full of twists and unexpected events , such a thrill ride . my only complaint lies with the ending . it felt a little rushed and even slightly predictable . also ( definite spoiler ) , i was concerned about the amount of time silo 17 ( the other silo ) had been abandonned . solo said it had been 34 years , but jules steps on soft , decomposing bodies upon entering . these would have been just a pile of fragile bones after so many decades . also , the band of children that are found are only in their teens at most , impossible if the silo had been empty for so long . but the writing is so superb that i have to give howey the benefit of the doubt and assume i missed something as a reader . great story , ca n't wait for the movie adaptation . also just downloaded the next omnibus in the series , shift.update : never mind me and all my silly over-thinking . hugh howey is a genius and the stupid details i was hung up on above are totally explained later in dust . : - )

> let me preface my review by saying i have an innate loathing of barbra streisand . my reasons are manyfold not the least her excreable left-wing politics . nobody was more gleeful than when trey parker and matt stone tweaked her on `` south park '' . giving the devil her due la babs in `` what 's up doc '' is ... tolerable . i watched this film mainly because i 'm a big fan of peter bogdanovich . i love his reverence for old movies . here bogdanovich pays homage to the screwball comedies of the thirties and forties . his reference point here seems to be howard hawks ' screwball masterwork , `` bringing up baby '' . bogdanovich is audacious in trying to evoke this classic and he mostly succeeds . the films strength is in the script 's witty verbiage . it falters slightly in the tired slapstick that permeates the latter part of the film . there 's a great cast that bogdanovich surrounds the diva with . ryan o'neal proves to be an adept light comedian here . bogdanovich later employed o'neal to better use in `` paper moon '' in 1973. only stanley kubrick with `` barry lyndon '' seemed to fully utilize o'neal 's talents . the support here is a dream with madeline kahn , kenneth mars , austin pendleton , and john hillerman . i particularly liked liam dunn in a small part as a harried judge . not classic but a great homage to a style of comedy that will never go out of fashion .

> for a band that only made two complete albums in their heyday , the gin blossoms still have an awesome legacy . as one of the many 90 's bands that appeared in the jangle-pop rush afterr.e.m.made the world safe for these groups , `` hey jealousy '' and `` found out about you '' seemed omnipresent andnew miserable experiencebecame a best seller . the band seemed to effortlessly combine the guitar of the byrds with a rootsy sense of rocking.the effortlessness camouflaged serious issues in the band ; chief writer doug hopkins ' depression and drinking ( which fed into the darkness 's of the band 's best lyrics ) drove him to quit the band and ultimately commit suicide . while his songwriting was missed on the follow-up album , congratulations ... i 'm sorrystill had the hit `` follow you down '' and the snarky `` day job '' to show the gin blossoms might survive without him . but that was it , and the band folded soon after . `` outside looking in '' splits the albums and adds a soundtrack fave , `` til i hear it from you , '' fromthe empire records soundtrack . there 's also a previously unreleased live track . `` whitewash . '' it 's all the good stuff and a fine overview of a band that could have been contenders .

> like many albums of its genre , herbie hancock 's & quot ; head hunters & quot ; is so influential , that newer musicians liberally borrow its style without even knowing it . once a member of miles davis 's incredible quintet of the 1960 's , hancock branched out into his own and released a series of albums that experimentally fused jazz with funky vibes . & quot ; headhunters & quot ; is probably the most successful and definitely the most popular . the opening bassline of the funky 15 minute & quot ; chameleon & quot ; sets the tone for the rest of the album as a timeless journey through some forward-thinking soul . & quot ; watermelon man , & quot ; replete with an arsenal of pretty flutes before the bass kicks in , has been sampled and distorted numerous times , most successfully by madonna , who used this groove in her 1994 song & quot ; sanctuary. & quot ; though the album clocks in at just over 40 minutes and has only 4 tracks , hancock 's & quot ; head hunters & quot ; packs a greater punch than many albums at twice the length . you can do your cd collection no wrong by picking this one up . it 's an influential masterpiece .

> less a novel and more accurately 5 short stories connected by a character absurdly named professor dr moritz-maria von igelfeld , von igelfeld is a satirical version of a full-of-himself college professor who pompously views himself as someone who is always on the precipice of getting the respect and admiration of his colleagues that he is certain he deserves . the institute of romance philology is von igelfeld 's home base , but von igelfeld spends an inordinate amount of time trying to win that respect and admiration as he continually gets into situations that inevitably go south in disastrous ways.the way von igelfeld is written comes across like an accident waiting to happen . think about a character that floats through life completely oblivious to what 's going on around him . it reminds me of mr. magoo and the old movie comedian charley chase being sort of hideously conjoined . by the time i hit the second story , it was obvious that there was going to be a lot of repetition with this character and his inevitable attempt to get respect . while the writing is fairly good , the von igelfeld character is n't particularly good or interesting , and the plot development is a tad lackluster .

> ( four and a half stars ) the first book took place in lyra belacqua 's world and the second book takes place in a new world between hers and the one we know that is infested by specters , a ghostly personage that feasts on those who have passed puberty.this book introduces a new character , will parry , who is thrown into this series when he comes across a doorway between our world and this new world . inside he befriends lyra and finds a powerful knife which can be used to move between worlds.together , will and lyra join together to pull each other through their challenges as lyra learns more of her great destiny and improves her understanding of dust and the origins and usage of the alethiometer.the action is n't as strong as the first book , but this is still a wonderful story . if you 've read and enjoyed the first book i would highly suggest picking up this one and continuing from the first book 's cliffhanger . a lot of questions are answered in this book and a few more questions are introduced as well . it all makes for a fantastic finish in the third book .

> this mug works as advertised . my coffee is still hot when i drink it 3 hours after pouring . i usually do n't have any left at 5 hours to test the temperature then ... i 've only put black coffee with no sugar in the mug , and i rinse it out every night when i get home . no issues with mold or anything so far . it did leak all over my backpack once because a water bottle next to it weighed enough to open the valve . this was my own fault because i did n't consider the limitations of the product . now i use an external pocket and take a little more care when setting my pack down . overall very happy with the purchase . way better that hauling a giant stanley thermos to work every day .

> what seemed like a normal life turns out to be anything but . this ends up testing the strength of the main character and her ability to trust and believe in anyone around her when she finds herself in the situation of being lied to and betrayed by everyone that matters to her.you root for her to do the right thing and see that she is a survivor ! well written and empathetic . understanding the trauma and it 's effects takes either an intuitive or someone who has been through their own experiences . being able to convey to others the level of emotional devastation takes talent and this author has plenty of it ! not light reading but pulls you in and gets you fully invested !

> i like the & # 34 ; artorian chronicles & # 34 ; series but i found this particular volume to be the least zippy of the series . maybe it is simply that the roman invasion of britain has been done too many times . in this one there are no good guys or bad guys , and it reminds the reader that most wars , and certainly these wars , were mostly pointless exercises in greed and plunder . the characterizations in this novel are weak , and leave the reader with no one to root for . at least that is how it was for me . rjb .

> i have purchased and used these mediabridge cables and found them to be entirely satisfactory ; the only reason i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they generally cost more than the amazonbasics equivalents , which perform equally well.i have found that 6 ft or 6.5 ft cables are sufficiently long to meet most hook-up needs , but i have encountered a couple of situations where longer ( 9/10/12 ft ) cables were needed , so be sure to measure your setup to determine just how long a cable you need before you order it .

> `` run the earth , watch the sky '' is an exquisite set of pop tunes about faith and god . on most cds , if there are 2 or 3 songs i really like , it 's successful . on this disc , there are 6 ! `` wonder '' is a joyful pop nugget with chris ' expressive baritone gently caressing the lyric , `` shall we dance from opposite sides of the universe ? and we 'll shine the glory behind all our spins & turns as we orbit our way through the sky . '' what a lovely picturing of man reaching for god and god for man ! `` my cathedral '' is a sweet acoustic melody about the joys of worshipping outdoors , `` here beneath the blue skies , i ran down to be baptized . '' `` circle up '' is a sweet melody with a delightful vision of men & angels all joined in worship , `` great & small , angels all & seraphim , grab a hand , twirl a dance , circle up & worship him ! '' it 's a delightful track . `` untitled hymn '' is a comforting melody that starts simple with piano before the strings come in as the song builds from loneliness to joy . `` spare an angel '' is a song that touches a deep chord for those whose hearts are troubled and no human comfort seems to satisfy . it 's an elegant statement of compassion . `` me & becky '' is such a perky track that it makes me think it ought to be a tv theme song . while i 've cited my favorites , none of the other tracks are weak . this set by chris rice is extremely strong with a positive delightful vision . bravo !

> the natural course of the seasons means that there is a cycle of birth , death and rebirth . once upon a time a group of children made a snowman using the standard ingredients of a bag of coal , a carrot for a nose and sticks for arms . after he is built the children go elsewhere and he is lonely . more than the ordinary snowman , he is plagued by self doubt , starting to wonder if he has done something wrong . he is also concerned about his appearance , thinking that the children somehow found him repulsive.he is cheered when a rabbit comes along and they become good friends , talking for hours about the features of the forest they live in . however , spring and warm weather arrive and the snowman melts away and the rabbit is now the one plagued by self doubts . fortunately for the rabbit the excitement and new life of spring enliven his spirits and he soon forgets about his friend . as summer turns to fall , the rabbit once again thinks of his snowman friend . when the snow arrives , he returns to where he met the snowman and to his delight , the snowman has returned.this story is a nice one about friendship and the thought that friendships have eternal and changing aspects is a good lesson for children to learn . young readers would realize that the doubts expressed by the snowman and rabbit have no basis in fact and they will understand why the circumstances are the way they are . while i do think the author gets close to the boundary of too much self doubt being expressed , it is never crossed , so this is a very good story for young people .

> the interesting introduction by neuroscientist melvin l. morse refers to the work of evolutionary biologist rupert sheldrake and physicist paul davis . browne 's own style is conversational , even folksy , and quite engaging as there 's lots of common sense , humor and positivity . she deals with subjects like inter alia miracles , d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu , coincidence , synchronicity , astral travel and the development of the individual 's psychic abilities . her take on the soul-mate myth made me laugh while her explanation of imprints , kinetic energy , hauntings , ghosts and spirits are informative and interesting , whether you agree or not . the chapter on psychic protection is valuable , while her warnings against cults should be taken seriously by everyone . helpful meditations are provided , for example one for examining past lives . she 's very honest in stating that no psychic is able to make correct predictions all the time and admitting her own failures . in this regard , her chapter of predictions for the new millennium does contain some errors , e.g . that breast cancer would be preventable and curable by the end of 1999. the book concludes with an appendix of affirmations . although this work has inspired a fair deal of negative criticism and although there are aspects of her cosmology that i disagree with or that i consider too simplified , there 's no denying that the other side is an enjoyable reading experience . one does n't have to agree with everything to derive enormous insight and pleasure from this book .

> of course , the h.g . wells story had its greatest impact in 1938 when , under the general command of the very young orson welles , the supervision of houseman , and the direction of paul stewart , with john garfield in a small part and the mercury players performing , a radio program drew nationwide attention with its halloween presentation . hadley cantril , then associated with a research group in princeton , nj , did the standard contemporary study of why some people credited the cautionary fictional tale with being real.spielberg follows an earlier film version with a good technical feat of creating crashing buildings and general chaos following the invasion by alien monster machines . unfortunately , these films must also have a human cast . spielberg gets a good job from tom cruise , as a working class father , who has been given care of their two children by his ex-wife , while she and her current husband are going out of town ( to boston from nyc ) for the week-end . their adventures , in trying to escape the monsters and the mobs of frightened people , is a reasonable accompaniment to the technical aspects of the picture.my only real complaint is that spielberg still has the monsters walking on three long , spidery metal legs ; very awkward for an advanced civilization.this may not be the final word on alien attacks , but it is a pretty entertaining one .

> i love using this on my face . rose water is an excellent skin toner and smells delightful . it dries without a trace so works extremely well before serums and other creams or under makeup.another use i 've found was using it as a simple rinse after hair color . i 'm at that age where i have to get my hair colored , or at least the roots , every few weeks . otherwise everyone will see my silver streaks and know i am lying when i claim i do n't remember the 80s . anyway , color always makes my scalp itchy and irritated for a few days . because of the anti-inflammatory properties of rose water i decided to give it a try after my last color . voila ! i am no longer walking around kicking my back leg up and scratching behind my ears like a cocker spaniel . it really relieved the itch and it also smells amazing -- and hair color does n't always smell so great for a few days.note : my first order of this arrived broken in the box ( that box still smells amazing ) so i contacted the seller who was very apologetic and got me a replacement so fast i could n't believe it . just thought it was a good sign that this company clearly stands behind their products and takes care of their customers.sample provided for unbiased review .

> mia voss is a forensics expert who is having a bad day . while on her way home from an ice cream run , she 's carjacked , robbed , and witnesses the murder of a passerby who happens to be a retired cop , and as she tries to escape , she 's shot also . when former flame ric santos is called in to investigate , she 's forced into close quarters with him when additional attempts are made on her family and herself . will they be able to forget the past and form a future before the killer succeeds ? i will admit that i went into this story expecting to be completely lost as it is the third in a series of books . i was pleasantly surprised to note that it is a stand alone novel - there are recurring characters , but unlike in other series romance , they do not overpopulate and detract from the story . ric is a classic hero - full of commitment issues , but his character and what drives him is very well written . as always , griffin 's writing is crisp , her dialogue realistic , and the pacing of the story very brisk . and best if all , i was guessing all the way to the end ! she is a not to be missed author - this is just the latest example !

> i bought this at a local store because it looked sturdy and well-built . when i took it home , alas , it was a royal pain in the neck to put together ! i 'm using the with-harness option , and adjusting the harness height and the crotch position was a true exercise in total frustration . the manual is poorly written and the drawings not helpful.my toddler seems comfortable in the seat , and it has a cupholder and two small storage compartments . problems with this made-in-china product have come to surface : one of the arm rests shakes , and the tether strap ( for latch ) is never totally tight . ( but the main latch straps are doing a good job . ) this car seat was not tested by consumer reports so we will not know whether it 's a truly safe restraint for our children . we just have to put our trust in the manufacturer.anyway , i really hate the assembly required to get this car seat to install properly , and i 'm not looking forward to the future day when i need to remove the built-in harness or the entire seatback . maybe some kind soul could post a video how-to ?

> an excellent representation of the 1920 opera with music by the 23 year old korngold , who also collaborated with his father on the libretto ( based on a story not by the korngolds ) . i was n't around to see the original nor the mets version a year later ; however , this production admirably captures the spirit of the times with its expressionistic design ( merging with the short lived dadaism ) complementing the early modern score . the lead singers are superb in vocally exhausting parts , with the male lead due very high marks for sustaining without weakening as demanding a role as there is in opera today . supporting roles are also performed with excellence and the acting fulfills modern definitions of the singer/actor . obviously each of us will see what our perspective allows and demands , for those of us who grew up with the cabinet of dr. caligari and other illusionist films exploring unconscious motivations and behavior ( in the era of psychoanalytic dominance in the arts ) little will appear strange.if the theme or music by korngold interest you , this is a fine experience .

> while visiting a museum a 13-year old boy survives a terrorist explosion that kills his mother . in the confusion and chaos of the moment he escapes with a priceless painting . thus is set in motion the events of this long and winding tale . all of life 's great concerns are examined : tragedy , pain , grief and suffering ; but also love , friendship , art and the arc of history . i initially was going to subtract a star because the book might have benefited from some editing ; but in the final analysis i believe it was necessary to describe events hour-by-hour , sometimes even minute-by-minute to really understand the heart and soul of the main character . this book affected me intellectually and emotionally in ways that very few novels have achieved in recent years .

> photography as artwork . that is one message from this book . it shows a french perspective on photoshop usage . the books for which are dominated by american authors , whose examples are typically of photos of recent vintage . taken from cameraphones , for example . certainly nothing wrong with that.but in this book , many examples are of much older photos . so much older that they often cry out for retouching ; maybe extensively . the authors guide you through painstakingly detailed methods of doing so . some examples , however , are much newer . like enhancing a commercial photo shot of perfume bottles . students of product design should appreciate that chapter.all the chapters should be easily understandable if you are already facile in photoshop . the book dives right into usage that assumes this experience .

> author evan thomas 's account of the life of john paul jones is an excellent narrative historical biography that brings to life yet another colorful personality from the american revolution . like his contemporary , alexander hamilton , jones was a vain , contentious and controversial figure of humble origins who rubbed many of those who knew him the wrong way . he also happened to be a rare and valuable commodity in revolutionary america in that he was a man who actually knew how to fight.as thomas dramatically illustrates , jones was virtually the only captain among the americans to have any success against the royal navy . jones 's raids against the british home isles and his daring defeats in two diferent battles against royal navy battleships made him famous world wide . thomas 's detailed accounts of the naval battles are particularly gripping . and while jones most likely never said the famous words , `` i have not yet begun to fight , '' that does not detract from his heroic refusal to surrender his ship in what was perhaps the bloodiest naval battle of the age of sail.thomas tracks jones 's entire life , from his childhood as the son of a scottish gardner , to his time as a merchant ship captain through his revolutionary exploits to the last , bizarre chapter in his life when he became an admiral in the russian fleet against the turks . thomas is evenhanded in his descriptions of jones , detailing his many faults in addition to his triumphs . in the end , the picture that emerges is of an essentially noble individual whose insecurities made him his own worst enemy . at just over 300 pages of narrative , the book is a relatively quick read and also has plenty of illustrations.overall , an outstanding historical biography that should be enjoyed by history buffs and even by more casual readers .

> crazy heart is not a bad movie , it is just a repetitive movie - yet another story about a down and out alcoholic/druggie/choose your addiction who has a life turn around moment and climbs out of the mess of a soup he/she made of life . no need to go into details as this film not unexpectedly garnered many nods at the oscars as have the many , many other films with the same theme in the past . yes jeff bridges is credible as the filthy has been alcoholic country singer bad blake , and perhaps it is his ability to make us tolerate his abominable behavior and still stick by him ( his modus operandi on his descent into nothingness ) that makes his performance gather attention from critics . but unless you are willing to spend the first two-thirds or more of the long film watching him vomit and misbehave , long enough to see his typical aa turnaround and attempt to make up for the deeds soaked in his alcoholic past , you may tire of the theme . maggie gyllenhaal gives a solid performance as a woman so bruised by her men of the past that she is able to catch a glimpse into the potential of bad blake . colin farrell makes a brief but significant appearance as one of the reasons for bad 's going off track . the rest of the cast feels well in tune with the country western crowd and makes us understand the need for music heroes . but in the end it is just another hard luck story , of which there are just too many . maybe reading thomas cobb 's novel by the same name would provide more reason to care about bad than we do . grady harp , april 10

> leaving three rivers , new hampshire , caelum and maureen quirk accept positions in the denver area . however , caelum never envisioned teaching creative writing to untalented averse students . he becomes even angrier over what his wife was doing.meanwhile maureen is a nurse at columbine high in quiet littleton . as caelum , who is in new hampshire caring for a sick aunt , and others are watching the news in horror in april 1999 two students go on a shooting rage . caelum fears the worse for his wife ; as his creative mind ponders in fear if she is still alive and following the massacre how will she cope with survivor guilt.this is a deep look at the aftermath of the columbine tragedy as wally lamb shows how the survivors of the massacre suffer from a variety of emotional issues including survivor guilt . the story line is character driven as caelum in new england especially goes through a myriad of emotions while maureen who cowered in a cabinet wonders what she could have done to stop the carnage . the rumination that every family harbors potential killers like the two teen suicide mass murderers seems unnecessary ; the profundity of the tale is with the way people find defense mechanisms to cope with an unforeseen trauma . the hour i first believed is a super tale that will leave readers filled with anguish and wondering how to prevent this and virginia tech from occurring at a time when people arrive at volatile presidential events wearing provoking dress statements of semi automatics as suspenders.harriet klausner

> putting flavor on regular water really depends on one 's preference . i am curious and very intrigued with this new product that i tried the following three flavors : peach-mango , sweet tea and peach tea . out of the three , i prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango . although i prefer water in its plain form , the taste is not far from ready-to-drink flavored water available commercially . if you like those , it might worth to try as you more control in what flavor and much flavor you want to put in your water.mio is very concentrated `` water enhancer '' - i never heard of those words until now . a small bottle can be used 24 times . the plastic bottle has a unique way of dispensing , it will not leak unless you squeeze the bottle for a squirt - one squirt , one serving , and one squirt is enough for a 6- to 8-ounce glass of water . of course you can squirt more it depends how squirt happy you are . the amazing thing is that even if i do n't stir it , just letting it stands for 20 seconds and the flavor spreads.it uses the artificial sweetener called sucralose , whose scientific name is splenda ( ok , i probably have mixed them up ) . anyway , it is 600 times sweeter than sugar and has 0 calorie . mio is also gluten-free ... .it 's still plain water for me .

> the tenth circle : a novel , by jodi picoult , is an `` almost as good as you 'd expect from a picoult novel , '' but not quite.the `` tension of life and living '' is the way i 'd describe the uniqueness of picoult 's writing . she `` gets it . '' in the case of the tenth circle , the `` getting it '' part is the tension of teenage angst over relationships , the meanness of kids , fathers letting go as their little girl grows up , and date rape confusions . what picoult misses here is engaging the `` missing mother '' into the action and giving the reader a bizarre ending in ... alaska ? ( the story really is located in maine ) . so i was troubled , and disappointed , by the jump from maine to alaska , as if that is the easiest thing in the world for a young teenage girl to decide to do . the bush of alaska is simply not on the radar screen for runaways ! and the revelation of the `` who done it '' at the end was much weaker than i expected.nevertheless , the tenth circle made me gasp at picoult 's expert capture of that `` tension of life and living . '' and although i was at first irritated by the comic book images interspersed throughout the text , they really were worked well into the overall flavor of the book .

> grave encounters is the first `` video oriented let 's pretend it 's a real paranormal experience movie '' that is truly frightening . directed by the vicious brothers , the film slowly builds reaching a chaotic crescendo . the story follows the typical `` dedicated '' ( to high ratings ) film crew of a new hit ghost hunters-clone tv show called grave encounters who are filming their sixth episode set in a creepy abandoned mental institution . they are locked in until six a.m. the following morning expecting typical paranormal cliches like strange noises or occasional cold spots . fortunately for the viewer , we get much much more.what sets grave encounters apart is that the usually annoying jerky camera shots are n't overused and actually heighten the suspense . and things actually happen instead of being covertly implied . this movie outshines the paranormal activity franchises or any of television 's `` reality '' paranormal series.sean rogerson ( tv 's harpers island ) is quite effective as lance preston , the show 's egocentric host.stylish and disturbing , grave encounters sets a new standard in this genre 's milieu .

> i expected to hate this . the opposite - i loved it . i would definitely pass up any of the strongly branded candy bars to have another of this one.to me the health concept seems deceivingly simple . the ingredients list some fattening substances such as fractionated palm kernel oil , for example . that 's probably the higher melting point fraction of palm oil normally associated with rich chocolaty foods . there are other types of oils as well and also corn syrup . it 's not a substitute for whole food items.however , in the midst of all the junk food ingredients there are vitamins . this seemed strange to me and i could n't get imagine it having vitamins when eating it.in my view , there is a place for this food . it seems to be a supplement or even a substitute for regular junk food . and it made me consider what food would be like if the fda insisted on junk food having some actual nutrition value .

> this is an appealing mix of secular and devotional christmas songs by the once upon a time disco diva . they are all ballads , there 's nothing to dance to here , but the album is a classic of its genre . on several tracks donna is backed by the nashville string quartet and by various choirs on others.the two slow ballads white christmas and the christmas song are followed by a rousing version of o come all ye faithful , where donna is assisted by a children 's and men 's choir . another highlight is the christmas medley consisting of what child is this/do you hear what i hear ? /joy to the world , a most impressive arrangement.i 'll be home for christmas comes across as a bit mournful , whilst christmas spirit is joyful and optimistic . the beautiful devotional breath of heaven has a spoken intro . it is a most stirring piece of music with a magnificent melody and soaring vocals . equally moving is o holy night , a slow , tender song with a gospel choir.the album concludes with lamb of god . this one also has a spoken intro from the gospel and a lovely inspirational sound with its children 's and adult choirs . this wonderful album is on a par with two other great chrismas albums by female vocalists : noel by noel baez and light of the stable by emmylou harris . i highly recommend it .

> in the culture code the author , clotaire rapaille , compares and contrasts the culture code of products and habits of americans with those of people in other countries , most often france , his native country . he asserts that what we say we want is n't what we really want and what we want is determined by previous experience or 'imprinting ' -- and that is different from culture to culture , often determined by the culture we grow up in.rapaille introduces us to the culture code with the example of cars . what we say we want is fuel economy and safety . but what we really want is image and a feeling of freedom , feelings we associate with cars from our 'imprinting . 'he continues to unlock the 'code ' for many of our most closely held behaviors from work and money to the american presidency . and , he describes how cultures and corporations have created their own codes in order to promote ideas , concepts and market merchandise.the culture code is n't a new concept , but it is an interesting one that you might want to be fully aware of the next time you go to make a big-ticket purchase , or formulate your stance on a political issue or cultural icon.armchair interviews says : another way to look at our cultural norms and expectations .

> there are some british procedural detective novels that just work . this is clearly one of series with a lot of back story , but it 's the first one i read , and i while i 'm sure i missed nuances , it worked well enough as a standalone . tom thorne is a stroppy policeman , who hates the political games and is n't that good about talking about things in his personal life either . at a difficult time in his personal life he is dumped into what initially could have been a simple domestic , but it soon becomes clear that there is nothing simple going on but rather a serial killer playing off the killings of another serial killer . it 's fast paced and easy to read . sometimes these kinds of books are beautifully well written , this one is serviceable and professional but not beautiful . i would pick up another one of his , but i 'm not moved to scour for all the back copies . i like police procedurals and this is a better than average , interesting one , but it 's not a jewel , like john sanford 's prey series.rules of prey ( lucas davenport )
= solid british police procedural
< a good start to a great series

> the product description of palimpsest really intrigued me . i thought the idea that people might end up in this mysterious place and have strange tattoos of a map which lead there . i was also intrigued by the narration of aasne vigesaa who is quite possibly my favorite audio book narrator and who also narrated kelley armstrong 's bitten.i confess after listening to this for a while that i absolutely could n't stand the writer 's style or the story . the writing is oddly pretentious as though every word the writer puts down on paper must be gilded and overly descriptive , this is especially bad in audio form since the wordiness is quite protacted and difficult to avoid . the story was also to fantastic and surreal like a bad hallucinogenic drug.i was disappointed , because even my favorite narrator could n't make me want to finish this story.of interest was that the title of palimpsest means : `` a manuscript on which two or more successive texts have been written , each one being erased to make room for the next . ''
= err.. no
< not as good as the first one

> the dancers gene kelly and fred astaire used to insist that their dance sequences be shot with a minimum of cuts and in such a way that their full body was held in the frame . that is the way jackie chan should be shot as well . what 's the point of doing your own stunts if the use of close-ups , rapid cuts and slow-motion is going to make you look like every other action hero in a hollywood movie ? i suppose the director , tom dey , ca n't be given all the blame for that since jackie chan 's own production company was responsible for this film . ( could it be that jackie has reached a point where he feels that he needs some help from the camera ? ) aside from that , this film is a lot of fun . chan and owen wilson have good chemistry . wilson plays his earnest , laid-back outlaw like a california surfer transplanted to the old west , but it works ! if only the action had been better ...
= fun , but not up to chan 's usual standards
< jackie chan 's own production

> this film did n't meet its full potential . the plot had a lot of potential ( organize a train to rescue the residents of a congolese town full of europeans from the rebel simbas ... and collect a fortune in diamonds in the process ) and the costumes and the locations were great . but certain bits in the film did n't make sense : why did the mercenary captain in charge need the ex-nazi to complete the mission ( it could n't be because his african troops had any sense of loyalty to him ) ? why was the congolese nco only a senior sergeant ( in the congo following independence education and military experience amongst africans was at a premium and a man of his ability would have been an officer ) ? why would the train commander allow the german guy to get away with attacking him with a chainsaw ( nobody needs somebody else this bad ! ) ? still a decent movie , if for no other reason because there are so few movies on the african wars .
= i was prepared to really enjoy this film but ...
< a decent movie

> louise penny is one of the more literary of detective story writers , creating characters and settings which are intriguing in and of themselves . in addition , in this book , she has set up a puzzle those who like such elements of mysteries will like . her leading character is chief inspector armand gamache , who , with his two colleagues , make up the problem solving team . the setting is a hotel resort in the wilds of canada . one of a family party is killed while the inspector and his wife are staying at the resort lodge celebrating their wedding anniversary . from that point , the author explore the interrelationships within the family , now and in the past , and between the family and others.the book is not the quick read of the usual paper-bound meant to offer divertissment without too much reading . it is solid but not boring ; the time reading it does not grow leaden . all in all , it can be commended to anyone seeking escape with some depth .

> terry pratchett continues with his witty and entertaining discworld series , where the planetary disc rides on the backs of four elephants standing on a turtle traveling through space.after that , you should expect anything ! this is my second discworld book , following mort . i do n't know whether mort was written before or after guards ! guards ! and it did n't matter ! i can see pratchett 's style ... a lot of new characters and hints at old characters and events.in guards ! guards ! , carrot finds out he is n't really a dwarf , and is sent off to the big city for fame , fortune , and a non-dwarf mate . he takes life and his job a little more seriously than his peers , and when an `` extinct '' dragon appears , he is the man on the spot.young adult literature , for the young at heart .

> these cartoons are hysterical ; my particular favorites are those that involve puns or wordplay . for example , on page 62 the illustration features clowns and flying pies . the caption reads , `` in the corridors of clowngress . '' on page 43 , there is an illustration of moray eels at a cocktail party and the caption reads , `` social morays . '' no topic is beyond larson 's reach . there is mike wallace 's interview with the devil , acts of god as a vaudeville production , the devil giving an updated weather forecast where the predicted cold front never appeared and the inside tour of the acme fake vomit company.the best cartoonists are geniuses and larson is one of the best . i enjoyed every cartoon in this collection ; they are funny and profound at the same time .

> a piercing , intelligent look at a high-minded , dysfunctional family in 1980s brooklyn , baumbach 's semi-autobiographical comedy transcends the clich & eacute ; s of the divorce drama for an unflinching portrait of four oddballs mired together in the crazy glue of family . daniels is a revelation in the role of bernard , a pretentious windbag who shacks up with a too-young student ( sarah polley ) and lacks the minimum quotient of paternal camaraderie his older son walt clearly longs for . linney , meanwhile , get involved with a hunky , uncomplicated tennis pro ( william baldwin ) to the chagrin of punchy pre-teen frank . tender and ingratiating one moment , caustic and cynical the next , `` squid '' is a small marvel that redefines what 's meant by `` family film '' .

> this is the pan i prefer for high heat searing . the pan came pre-seasoned . however i did re-season it with a little oil and heated it for an hour in the oven . even so the meat stuck a little on the first use , and non after continued use . my purchase was in january of 2013. this is a good quality item . i have not had any problems with rust.after use , i allow the pan to heat up until it is very hot . i put hot water in it and it self cleans . i then wipe the pan out , oiling it lightly . i keep it stored tied up in an old pillow case with a sheet of paper towel between uses . i highly recommend this product .

> director david s. goyer continues his vampire vanity story here and it still pulls out some surprises . besides their usual dark comedy and slick special effects , he adds some new chemistry . there is a new team to replace kristofferson and they are all delightfully ex-vampires . the big surprise is that the endangered species of vampires are recreating themselves in big vampire factories . the biggest kick of all is that the original vampire himself , who has been self-exiled for decades due to his disgust in human nature , finally awakens . he does this in modern day iraq . now if that does n't make you laugh you have no time for this film . lots of excitement and comic book action here . do n't miss it .
= enough b-grade laughs for all suckers !

> i watched the brass teapot expecting a comedy with a fantasy spin . however , i got so much more that will have you analyzing the story developments over and over again . while the brass teapot is quite funny in a delightful kind of way , at times it becomes a dark psychological drama . i could n't help but put myself into the situation and imagine how much better i could have handled it -- and that is the very trap that ensnared souls into the lowest levels of their own corruption and evil over centuries.if you watch the brass teapot , expect the unexpected and definitely prepare to be amused , horrified , baffled and thoroughly intellectually and emotionally engaged from the very first scene.very , very highly recommended .

> this is a great device ! i love the kidstime feature , absolutely fabulous for a kids device and parental control . the device is fast , flows wonderful and great ( wish i gotten one for myself ) .the only and very small thing i wish was different in kidstime was that when you making changes or settings as a parent that you can shut off or snooze the need for the password . there are times when your adding an app or function to the device i feel like i 've punched in my number 5 times to do something . but honestly that 's a small issue to get over for what it provides - just the snooze option for it would be a nice little addition/update .

> i have nothing new ti input . i have the same gripes as everyone else . the next page button on the right is too large and teh thing just looks down right archaic . my biggest issue is that i 'm sure amazon will release a newer and cheaper version sometime in the near future and all of us that were early supporters are going to get hosed . i have been tempted to return my kindle and hold out for the new one but i just adore it so much and without a definite release date for the new version , i 'm not sure i can wait that long for another one .

> very riveting story , after reading first 5 chapters i thought stor is over . author 's way of stretching a simple plot with good dialogues makes it interesting . at times , story does seem to be dragging . researching the death row , and its gruesome details ... the end was a bit unpredictable . i thought it will be different . that is the power of imagination . i am not sure how many people in us are against death penalty now , but the story revolves around pre civil war era type usa , and its transition to a modern age 1990s .

> this is one of those classic movies you just wish you could have watched when it first came out in the movie theaters and you or no one else in the audience knew what was coming ! even if you know the basic story outline complete with the big `` surprise '' and have seen some of the many parodies and copies of the film the original psycho is a very enjoyable viewing experience for any horror/suspense fan . from the memorable music to the perfect casting psycho is truly a masterpiece .

> cerebral mystery story operates on several levels . we get to know the murdered man through flashbacks and see how many people had a motive to kill him . set on top of this is the condescension with which investigation is treated by the white brass . all ingredients make for a meaty , involving murder tale shedding light on racism of the time . young denzel is particularly strong in a pivotal role , and caesar was nominated for an oscar for his portrayal of the loathsome waters .

> this film is a watered down version of the hand held camera genre . in instances where they did n't use home video footage , they filmed the scene bad enough to make it feel like found footage . the movie opens showing us a family being hung in their back yard . true crime author ellison oswalt ( ethan hawke ) moves into the same house with the intention of investigating the gruesome killing and writing about it . the locals are not warm to the idea , but we do n't see any incidences due to budget constraints . ellison does n't inform his family they are in the same house that the killings took place.in the attic , ellison discovers a horde of super 8 movies ( some that have their own sound track , or so it seems ) of the killing he is investigating as well as other killings that date back to the 1960 's . he asks the questions , `` who is filming this ? '' and `` why ? '' and `` where is stephanie ? '' she was the daughter of the family that was hung . they never found her.ellison begins to investigate the other cases as weird things start to happen in the home . as usual it starts out slow and escalates.i liked the concept of the film more than its amateurish execution . ellison drinks rather heavily which makes for an alternate explanation of his `` hallucinations . '' the film would have been better if it had lead us in that direction , rather than just discuss it . those who enjoy the `` paranormal '' type movies should find a friend in this film . i loved the film in the beginning , but then it slowly wanes . thumb rule : when you think demons are in your house , turn on the lights.parental guide : no f-bombs , sex . or nudity . snuff films . 3 1/2 stars . should scare the kids during a sleepover at trent raznor 's house .

< a watered down version of the hand held camera genre

> this third entry in the jack caffery series really stands apart from the previous two volumes - and unfortunately not in the most fortunate light . jack has changed locales , so the series shifts to a whole new setting . this change of scenery not only gives jack a new job , but it leaves behind the people who appeared in the earlier volumes with little more than mentions about them , and certainly nothing that would constitute as an update.the storyline is also more straightforward , without very many twists or turns . and the level of depravity and overall horrific atmosphere and actions that define the earlier books ( and most of hayder 's other , standalone novels as well ) is missing here , giving this the feel of your more standard mystery/thriller . it is a complete departure from the earlier books in the series . because it sticks more to the conventional thriller , it will undoubtedly appeal to more readers ( though they will be in for a shock if they decide to go back and read the first two volumes , as they are really nothing like this one ) .the book did disappoint me a bit - there were some pretty major storylines left somewhat open at the end of the treatment and i had hoped that they would be addressed here . unfortunately , this was not case . but , even though it did not meet my expectations , it was not a bad book at all - genuinely interesting and entertaining . i am definitely curious to see where the series will go from here .
= almost seems like a new series ... .
< not a bad book , but not a bad book

> i read the 2013 edition of empty net , the 3rd book in the assassins series . it probably could stand alone , but there is quite a bit of back-story that does n't get referenced early enough , and that hampers the reader . each of ms. aleo 's books has gotten better since her relationship with loveswept and her editor has cemented . toni 's books are character driven , and she spends a great deal of time setting scenes . she uses pop culture references and music to great advantage ; allowing the reader a glimpse into the inner workings and motivations of the characters . are her books long ? yes , because she more than scratches the surface of her hero and heroine ; allowing the reader to become emotionally connected and invested . her characters are human , they jump to conclusions , argue , have irrational fears , choose the wrong direction often , but ultimately love wins the day . ms. aleo writes love stories , oh and by the way , there is some hockey . the secondary characters are strong and in each book ms. aleo gives us access to the characters from her earlier books , updates if you will.if you like your books to have characters that are flawed but able to grow and change , like a happily ever after , enjoy witty dialogue , and want to stay with a story for more than wham bam , thank you ma'am - toni aleo may be your author . *i received my copy from netgalley.com in exchange for an honest review .

< a great book !

> this novel truly stunned me . i came into this is a pretty avid twilight fan , as are , i 'm sure , many othe readers . i did n't , however , expect to love it . i think that i actually enjoyed this novel far more than those in the twilight series . i cried and cried and cried , but i also laughed , too . i loved both wanda and melanie . i loved every character , from jared and jamie to ian and kyle . i loved them all . this was such an emotional novel for me and i really was swept away . i finished this book in about 3 days ( i would have read it in a far shorter amount of time if work had n't have gotten in the way ) .this book is n't just another science fiction book , or another romance novel . it has elements of both , but this book is so much more . there 's a soul-searching ( excuse my pun ) deepness that made it so much . it 's so hard to describe , but this book meant so much to me . i felt it all the way to my soul ( again with the pun ) and i am seriously contemplating reading it again soon . if you choose to not read this book , you will be missing so much . it is amazing , and that is n't nearly doing it justice .

> this is the latest in the serge storms series of novels . they are all set in florida , present day , and reflect the growth of the criminal population in that state . serge is a serial killer but he kills the bad guys , especially guys who are bad for florida ! he was born and raised in florida so adores it and he prizes the early artifacts from its less populous past.in this book serge is celebrating christmas in tampa . he misses the davenport family . he prizes their middle american ordinariness . so he moves across the street from them , much to the wife 's despair . however , martha has a tendency to get herself into trouble and bad guys come looking for her . like when she reports a mall cop and gets him fired . not to worry though when your neighbor is a serial killer in an elf suit , ready to rid the world of anyone who is a threat to you.there are funnier serge books . this may be losing some of its comedic lustre . however , i read it overnight and enjoyed it so on balance would rather have a light and breezy serge storms than no serge storms at all . if you are looking for a light entertainment for this christmas season , this might be it .

> william holden , cliff robertson , and vince edwards turn in their customary fine performances in this excellent story about one of the early special operations units . the storyline is simple enough . a special ops unit is formed for a specific mission in norway ( the mission is eventually changed . nice bit part by michael rennie as general mark clark ) . for reasons i was never quite clear on , the unit is comprised of equal parts of american misfits and canadian elite troops . ( this is said to be historically accurate ) . my favorite part of the movie is the interaction between the american rogues and the more cultured , but equally tough , canadian troops . there are some hilarious scenes that take place during pre-combat training which show how the unit gelled together into an elite force.the action scenes are very well done , and the attitude of the regular army units towards the unconventional special ops unit is true-to-life . special ops units have traditionally , at least until recently , been the orphans of the army , and that is brought out very well in this fine movie.if you like a straightforward , well-acted war movie , this is one of the better ones .
= a darned good war flick about special ops .

> this is barilla 's plus pasta . it has higher protein and ala omega-3 . the higher protein is from extra grain and legume flour . apart from your regular semolina and durum , it also has flour from lentils , chickpeas , flaxseed , barley , spelts and oats , all wholesome ingredients . it also has the plant version of omega-3 , ala. unfortunately , it 's the dha and epa version of omega-3 that you want.fiber : you get 4g per 2oz serving , which is about the same as what you get from a slice of 100 % whole wheat bread.tastewise , it 's not bad . it 's a little chewier than your regular pasta but less than your whole wheat pasta . overall , i 'd say it 's not bad . you get double the fiber compared to regular pasta ( 4g vs 2g ) , more protein ( 10g vs 7g regular pasta ) , plus the ala o-3 , and it 's not too chewy . this is something i 'd rotate with my other pastas just to have something different now and again .

> marilee strong , a bright red scream : self-mutilation and the language of pain ( penguin , 1998 ) it amazes me how psychologists can take a series of seemingly unrelated symptoms , come up with a hypothesis , and be dead-on right . for the past twenty years , they 've been doing just that with the small , but increasing , segment of the populace who injure themselves through bloodletting , beating their heads against walls , breaking bones , and other such behaviors . strong , a journalist , boils all the research down and combines it with & quot ; thousands & quot ; ( as she says in the preface ) of interviews with the types of people profiled in the research . the end result is a powerful book about childhood trauma and its relation to self-destructive behavior . a very important piece of work that will go unread , or not understood , by those who most need it -- neglectful and abusive parents . ****

> this was my first daziel/pascoe mystery and i found it to be an interesting book with one awful cheat that almost ruined it for me . daziel , the nero wolfe type , pascoe , the gentleman , and sgt . wield , the biker cop , are involved in the odd disappearence of the local constable of enscombe . art , the loyal gentry , and a disturbed youth are all part of the mix . the characters are solid and the mystery plays fair with one exceptional red herring early on that changes the whole structure of the book until the end when you realize the author just threw it in for effect . despite this , i 'm willing to give this series another shot because the characters are so engaging ... and that 's really the reason most of us read these mysteries , is n't it ?

> rebecca bloomwood ( isla fisher ) is a young career girl who feels clothes and fashion define her . she has credit cards and overwhelming debt , but can not control her urge to shop . even store mannequins speak to her , begging her to buy more.rebecca wants a job at a fashion magazine . however , through quirky movie luck , she inadvertently finds a job at a financial magazine giving out financial advice on how to stay out of debt . now this premise is funny but the movie only gives mild smiles . isla fisher does her best to save the movie through a free and happy personality , but ca n't quite do it . the debt collector derek smeath ( robert stanton ) is the movie 's villain and he is dodged successfully by rebecca until she is on national tv giving out advice on savings.the movie is ironically timely with the global meltdown about the time of release - the sins of debt revealed - and derek smeath is standing up for ethical and moral responsibility so it was hard to dismiss him as evil.there is a `` i love lucy '' physical comedy , and look for the camera ( crazy dumb redhead ) , but you wonder how anyone could be so dense . rebecca is a bouncing bubbly air-head , selfish , spoiled , clothes horse , who has no control over her finances or life . the few laughs you have are hard to come by.i was impressed with the list of actors - all did their best - but they could not save this weak comedy : kristen scott thomas , joan cusack , john goodman , john lithgow and luke brandon . ( fisher also did her best , but sad script ) by the way , luke brandon played her boss and the romantic interest who never gave up on rebecca . he was the man who found her good points ( ? ) .

> this `` jack frost '' is not about the chilly killer like the one in thisjack frost 2 : revenge of the mutant killer snowman , but a `` heart-warming '' family story about an aspiring `` musician '' ( michael keaton , his glory days as the caped hero of gotham behind him ) who returns to his family thanks to a magical harmonica . the opening scene must be seen to be believed . keaton and his band ( which includes henry rollins ) are belting out -- -kiddie songs to a packed crowd of adults , who looove it ! really , is a drunken bar crowd really going to cheer for `` frosty the snowman '' ? maybe there is `` beer ears '' in addition to `` beer goggles . `` keaton dies in an accident , but his annoying young son revives him by playing the harmonica . he returns ... as a creepy snowman . conservative commentator michael medved claimed this movie was objectionable because it implies intimacy between keaton 's wife ( kelly preston , far from hermetalstorm : the destruction of jared-syn [ vhs ] glory days ) and the snowman/husband . frankly , preston spends most of the movie thinking her little boy is slightly delusional.for a kids ' film , it is awfully creepy ( such as the way jack frost strikes back at his son 's friends ) yes , the love scene between preston and keaton is objectionable , only because it brings up the birds and bees discussion before it 's time . this christmas movie makes you say , '' bah humbug ! '' avoid this movie . avoid it for the children . avoid it for the future .

> the family stone is one of those dysfunctional family comedies that boasts of its credibility , its bittersweet look at family life and familial relationships , and you know what -- -it does have all that , and a wonderful ensembled of good performances . while the romantic switches at the end are a little hard to swallow , one ca n't deny how real some of the dialogue and situations are . sarah jessica parker is wonderful as the uptight , apparently frigid girl friend brought home to meet her beau 's parents ; diane keaton gives one of her best recent performances as the mother whose initial acceptance of life is eclipsed by her own unhappy secret ; craig t. nelson is in top form as the father , a nice man who puts his family above all , but is n't afraid to voice his opinions either ; luke wilson ( a more versatile actor than his brother owen ) is the rakish ben , a loner with a simple outlook on life ; rachel mcadams is bitchy and quite good as the sister who does not like parker at all ; claire danes is marvelous as parker 's warmer sister who feels out of place with the gathering . only dermot mulroney as parker 's boyfriend weakens the cast ; he just does n't seem as real as the others , although by the end of the film he 's a little more tolerable.well written , the family stone is an enjoyable entertainment .

> add one part drama , one part emotion , and one part redemption , and you get broken vows by naiomi pitre . the novel addresses secret passions , forbidden affairs , and unrequited love while examining how all of these things affect christian values and faith.yvonne and dominick are a married couple who are n't without their share of trials . yvonne has been the breadwinner while dominick pursues his dreams , but , in the meantime , yvonne 's desires have been placed on hold . in the midst of their marital struggles , they both go outside their marriage in an attempt to fulfill their needs . however , they will need to assess what they truly mean to each other in order to move forward , whether together or apart.i was furiously flipping the pages of broken vows , intrigued by the arousing sex scenes and held in suspense as to what would come up next for the couple . i can attest that the author was able to invoke emotions in me , as i felt my face get hot and my blood pressure rise when i disagreed with the situations and how the characters handled them . although there were a few subplots that seemed to be left open-ended , the author has written a sequel , and it 's possible these issues will be addressed at that time . broken vows is highly recommended for anyone looking for a steamy , dramatic , plot-driven read.reviewed by candacekof the rawsistaz reviewers

> when it does come down to beauty , we often are looking for the best product to get rid of lifes , little facial escapes . for most of us , the hardest things to take out of our face , are nasty little blackheads , which mostly get caught up in our nose , and clog up in our pores . but , most facial products do n't show how good they can deliver . for biore ' , they have delivered very well at getting rid of our blackheads from our face , and that has continued to show with their picture perfect pore strips . i really was impressed at how much it got rid of after my first use . you simply wet your face , and put the pore strip on your nose , and let it set after around a half hour . then take it off , and you 'll see fewer blackheads on your nose . i absolutely recommend these biore ' pore perfect strips as a great buy for a picture pefect way at getting rid of your blackheads.price : b 1/2-convience : b+overall : b 1/2+

> the trip which elizabeth gilbert takes us on is informed everywhere by her great writing skill and intelligence . but her search for herself throughout the world , however charming at first , became for me a bit too extended . she sees the places she visits with the eyes of the upscale tourist and in relation to her own spiritual quest . their real realities do not seem to be that much for her . however in her writing about her close relations , description of her family members , and of her own feelings towards them she is superb . she demands a lot of herself , and is clearly a consciencous and caring person . what i think has attracted many about the book is the questing and adventurous spirit which is at the heart of it .

> i have loved this film since i was 9 ! high spirits is a whimsical comedy-fantasy from the visionary director neil jordan starring a superb cast.peter plunkett ( peter o'toole ) is the owner of castle plunkett , a gloomy castle set in the irish countryside . in order to get the money-hungry brogan family off his back , he decides to advertise the castle as the most-haunted place on the emerald isle ( with the hotel staff doubling as the spirits ) ! .among the cynical tourists that arrive are jack ( steve guttenberg ) and his valium-guzzling wife sharon ( beverly d'angelo ) ; a scientist of the paranormal ( martin ferrero ) , his wife ( connie booth ) and their children ; the chaste brother tony ( peter gallagher ) and the sexy miranda ( jennifer tilly ) .the `` ghosts '' are soon discovered to be fake , thus enraging the real ghosts of the castle who decide to make a little mischief for themselves ! jack finds himself falling in love with the elusive mary plunkett ( daryl hannah ) , while sharon is unwittingly courted by mary 's husband , the dead martin brogan ( liam neeson ) .director neil jordan envisioned a `` midsummer night 's dream '' -type atmosphere for this film with partner-swapping and people being seduced by other-worldly beings . however , producers soon had other things in mind and significantly re-edited the movie to their own vision . cast members came from the set complaining that the producers had enfuriated jordan with their antics , forcing him to walk off the project.however , the film is a constant delight , and this long-awaited dvd release will surely be relished by fans of the film.the dvd includes both the widescreen and full-frame versions of the film as well as the trailer .

> `` hysteria '' was hysterical ! what a delightful comedy . i totally loved it . it is ribald by nature of its subject matter . the comedy is emphasized by the complete ignorance of male physicians about female physical experience and the prudish manners of the era . maggie gyllenhaal seems atypical for a victorian woman of the 1880 's , but she 's got such great spark and gusto that she serves the film well as she did in `` do n't back down . '' hugh dancy from `` adam '' is such an unassuming but good-looking guy that he falls well into his part as the inventor of the vibrator . felicity jones is so prim as emily dalrymple , that she is a perfect foil to gyllenhaal 's charlotte , her character 's sister . the scenes where the doctors are bringing women to orgasm and terming it a `` medical treatment '' are hysterical , such as the opera singer hitting the high note as the electric powered vibrator proves its effectiveness . georgie glen is delightful as the aging widow mrs. parsons who winds up with jonathan pryce 's dr. dalrymple by the end of the film . the dvd extras are also wonderful . the interview sequence with pryce , dancy and director tanya wexler had me rolling in the aisles as they fielded wild questions about the film . ( i 'll never think of a sandbag in quite the same way again ! ) this film works incredibly well . it was not the most high budget film ever , and certainly never played at our local cinema , but is great comic entertainment . bravo !

> this book is eerily similar to elmore leonard 's `` the hot kid '' because both books begin with the title characters as young boys , and focus on an encounter each boy has with an fbi most wanted gangster . in leonard 's book the gangster gets shot , but in de haven 's book the guy is thrown into a wall after his gun explodes . really , that 's one of the few differences between the books.both books chronicle how the main characters grow up to become crime-fighters , and feature famous villains , women , and real-life events to set the tone and place . both books also feature clunky narrative writing that is awkward to read , and at times seems to be all about style and not at all about moving the story forward.the superman we all know from reading comic books does n't appear in this book until the very , very end . overall , it was n't worth the wait .

> nothing explicit here , nothing violent , nothing obscene , just a straightforward story of a mostly closeted gay professor living in 1960s california , dealing with the death of his lover ( we see their story in flashbacks ) and with his feelings for a couple of younger men , one of which is a student in his class . colin firth does a great job as the title character , with julianne moore in a brief but memorable role as a friend of his who is also an expat from london.there is a great soundtrack which probably is n't necessary for all the scenes where the music is played , but it is not too obtrusive or distracting .

> true faith must be historically consistent.it is too bad that killing jesus : a history has to be cluttered with bill o'reilly . the book is an engaging and well written narrative about jesus . it sets the cultural and historical context for his life better than most written works or sermons . the book is what it is ; about 1/3 from the gospel accounts , 1/3 well known history , and 1/3 reasonably speculative story about what went on around jesus during his life put together in a very readable format . it is well researched but not scholarly.killing jesus brings together the many facets of culture , personality , and politics around jesus . the jesus that comes through is brilliant , dynamic , and tough . he is the kind of man hundreds of millions of people would follow . the book does not discount that jesus was god and definitively posits the three choices that he is either a liar , lunatic , or divine . like a person observing in the first century ad , the reader is left to make their own decisions about jesus.if you want a single narrative of jesus 's story that is solely based on scripture , try & # 34 ; god with us : the remarkable story of jesus christ & # 34 ; on kindle . it makes a good companion volume to killing jesus.in spite of the many reviews , articles , and bill o'reilly 's ridiculous interview comments , the book does not overstep its historical bounds , lessen jesus , or even imply that his death was all about taxation . it does present a brilliant , highly engaging , and radical man who was put to death and leaves us with & # 34 ; to this day , the body of jesus of nazareth has never been found. & # 34 ; worthwhile reading and a fine tool to help bring jesus into focus

> follow along with three young and unlikely friends as a simple boat ride through the waters of an untamed florida becomes not only a dangerous journey , but an adventure of epic proportions sure to ignite the imaginations of readers old or young ! the river way home : the adventures of the cowboy , the indian and the amazon queen by mary e. dawson is filled with historical value and a sense of wonder and discovery as queenie , an educated young black girl , chief , a young seminole boy and billy , a young cracker boy with an as yet untapped , yet brilliant mind , brave nature , the elements and some dangerous outlaws , as they try to make their way to the safety of home.mary e. dawson has created a beautifully written novel brimming with true historical facts surrounding central florida in the days before man and the railroad tamed its vast lands , when word of mouth and tales of the past kept the spirit of the land alive . her characters are warm , sweet and innocent , but showed amazing poise , loyalty and true grit when called upon . ms. dawson 's world-building is like a mental trip through time , to the sights and smells of the ` jungles ' and wonders of florida that is both captivating and memorable . for younger readers , she has cleverly disguised history lessons in a book that begs to be read ! and i admit it i knew very little of what she so generously shared ! the river way home : the adventures of the cowboy , the indian and the amazon queen is a trip through the real florida , long before disney came along ! should you read it and share it ? definitely ! i sincerely wish to thank the author for allowing me the opportunity to share in this fantastic journey !

> walther gives a thorough rendition of asp.net 2.0. he explains the many improvements over version 1 , as good reasons to migrate from it . of these , the simplified accessing of a back end database might be the most compelling . while the idea of cascading style sheets has been expanded into master pages with themes . this allows easier maintenance of a large website that needs a consistent look and feel.the 2000 pages of this book are certainly impressive . one reason that the book is so long is because of the numerous code examples , written in asp.net and visual basic . with the accompanying cd having the corresponding code in c # . certainly , it is a good thing in general to furnish many examples . however , the listings tend not to be code fragments , as other texts might do , but complete code sets . what you think about this can depend on your background . if you are new to asp 2 , then perhaps the complete listings are useful . though if you take time to read through the book ( admittedly this will be some time ) , then you might also find full listings to be superfluous . while if you already know the essence of asp 2 , and need a comprehensive text , then you do n't really need full listings . all that does is take up space.what walther could have done is push the full vb code listings onto the cd , and just write appropriate snippets in the text . there should certainly be enough space on the cd for this . this would considerably lighten the text , and might actually make it easier to follow the ideas .

> this story about a husband 's attempt to get a new pair of pants hemmed for the eid celebration is a cute fable , but a child born in a christian faith may not understand what eid is and what the significance is . ramadan is a month-long feast practiced by devout muslims and it ends with a three-day celebration of eid , where people stay up late and drink , eat and be merry . it 's the muslim equivalent of christmas , which in the olden days was a three-day celebration as well.if readers do n't understand this , though , what do they get from the story ? it sounds sexist for one thing , with the husband asking his wife , mother and daughter to hem his pants `` four fingers long . '' none of the women have time for that as they are all preparing for eid , but then guilt gets to them and they grab the pants and each cuts off `` four fingers long . '' poor nabeel ends up with pants too short ! the illustrations are colorful but then again , without historical background the christian child sees women covered in burqas and the bearded men with head wrappings that are not traditional to american society.it 's good that muslim traditions are introduced in this book . perhaps the author meant to target this for muslim readers . it would score higher . this fable could be used as an introduction of the usa 's many religions and practices.s

> most readers wo n't rate this as one of the strongest books in ed mcbain 's beloved 87th precinct series , but if you do enjoy the other books in this series of `` police procedurals '' you 'll want to read this one too . i 'd give it something like a 3.5 rating , but because it 's mcbain he get the extra bump up . yes , this novel is a bit dated ; it was first published in 1964 and is littered with unfortunate phrases such as `` colored handyman '' and `` negro with an axe . '' but hey , that was the early 60s , and the dialogue reflects the speech patterns of that era . in that sense , this is very authentic . the language usage aside , the characters are memorable and the dialogue is surprisingly sharp and witty for something written nearly 50 years ago . other than the main case/crime , there is n't much in the way of sub-plots in this book , and mcbain does n't delve into the characters ' personal lives as much as he does in later books in the series . and at 141 pages , this is a short one too , but i ca n't summon up too much dismay or disappointment ; this was another fun read that i found impossible to put down . another very enjoyable 87th precinct tale .

> i owned the kindle fire for less than a year before it broke on me and when i full-filled my warranty i was given a gift card and i purchased the kindle fire hd . i had n't don much research about the changes that were made between the two different versions because i had n't been originally planning on getting a different product , but the kindle fire hd cost the same what the kindle fire had previously cost so it only made sense to purchase this version.bringing it home was exciting . we opened it out and got it all setup . the setup was easy to do and very quick . we were worried about linking the account since we had n't been able to unlink it from the first kindle , but they made that easy , too ! that was definitely plus ! the screen on this model is so much nicer and clearer . it makes it so much easier to see everything on the screen . the touch screen is more responsive and works better for games.internet browsing is n't much different . it is a little annoying though i do still browse the internet . the browser is just a little flawed . overall the kindle fire hd is great for reading books , playing games , and ok for browsing websites . this is a great tablet for an amazing price .

> the hardware is a nice clean package that is well made . the software in the box was out of date but a call to tech support got me a download of ez gig iii . i even got an unlocked copy of the software that works with other usb external drives and it is invaluable to back up the primary drives of my computers . i use the software with external usb hard disk drive cases to store mirrored files on normal 3 1/2 inch hdds.it took 24 minutes to copy my primary drive to an intel 160 gb ssd . no problems at all ! the software ran in windows 7 perfectly . the software transferred the data from the primary 1tb drive to the 160 gb drive and resized the partitions automatically . upon reboot with the old primary drive removed , the system converted the drive to the new ssd primary drive and relabeled it to drive c. could n't be easier . it is step by step with a clock to tell you how long it will take and how fast it is transferring data . it does not verify the data after transfer as the primary drive is still running windows.it was a good investment .

> when i was in high school , the budget way to big hair that did n't move was to spray it with sugar and water . this of course spawned the urban legend of women who found all sorts of nasties , from bugs to birds to small mammals to the long lost remains of jimmy hoffa in their dos . sadly , this product triggered the trip down memory lane.this styling aid is easy to apply . simply rub a dime size dollop between your palms and gently smooth on wet or dry hair . style , braid or twist as desired . unfortunately , the white milk like liquid had an odd odor , much like artificial food flavoring . the price of perfecting your style is icky , sticky hair . the unpleasant stickiness is more noticeable when applied to dry hair but still apparent when applied to damp tresses . luckily it does wash out easily.so as much as i like the staying power of this product , i am unwilling to sacrifice touchable softness for technique . factor in the weird odor and fly paper stickiness and it is a no for me .

> this is considered one of the great works of russian literature . the ambitious chichikov schemes to buy up the 'dead souls ' ( the names of serfs who have died since the last census and are not listed officially as dead ) from their previous owners . in doing so he hopes to establish himself as the owner of many ' souls ' and by pawning the souls become a wealthy man.in doing this he travels through russia meeting a variety of odd and interesting characters . one character , manilov gives his souls free of charge . another the greedy korobotchka makes a bargain of fifteen rubles per soul . sobakevitch demands a hundred rubles but his rudeness gets him only two- and - one half rubles per soul.chichikov pulls it off for a time , is recognized as wealthy , has many ladies running after him , but is last exposed by a character , nozdrev , who has refused to make a bargain with him.gogol 's fiercely satirical humor has made this work a russian reader 's delight.i am not sure however that the humor and the delight translate very well to english .

> tourmaline ceramic - i have very thin fine hair . i have found that this type of curling iron works best for my hair . the curl actually holds for several hours without styling products and with styling products last all day long.this curling iron as advertised heats quickly and maintains it 's heat.the tapered rod allows for a wider curl that narrows down on the end . this is great for longer hair . this produces a much better vertical curl than typical curling rods.if you are looking for a curling iron for a bob or similar cut this is not the curling iron . this iron produces beautiful vertical curls . but even with several attempts i could not get horizontal curls . i did not use a heat resistant glove results may be different with a glove.5 stars for creativity - both in the tapered rod and that it has no clamp.5 stars for quality construction5 stars for quality and longevity of curl4 stars for how it actually works without a clamp

> here 's the deal about incident at loch ness ( fox ) : celebrated filmmaker werner herzog ( `` the mystery of kaspar hauser , '' `` invincible , '' `` lessons of darkness '' ) is planning a documentary called `` enigma of loch ness . '' it 's going to be a look at the fabled scottish lake and the legendary , possibly mythic , `` monster '' that dwells within its cold , dark waters.hollywood screenwriter zak penn ( `` x men 2 , '' `` robin hood '' ) wants to make a documentary about the shooting of herzog 's film . and will go to any length to create situations that will add drama and excitement to his film about a film . he wants to win an award and be recognized.depending on your point of view and level of sophistication , `` incident at loch ness '' is either a shocking , cautionary documentary about the perils of `` artistic differences '' during a difficult location shoot or a laugh out loud faux film about the hijacking of herzog 's movie by an overweight , egotistical , callous hollywood hack who is directly responsible for the death of two of the documentary 's crew members.i liked the earnest , dead-pan consistency of all players in this quirky , off-center enterprise , especially herzog 's . and the conceit is never alluded to even in the twisted commentary track . when an angry herzog confronts penn 's deception and ineptitude and walks out of the commentary recording session , penn continues in fits and starts with other disgruntled members of the crew , finally ending with his acid-tongued , soon-to-be ex wife 's comments . i loved this hilarious skewing of a certain hollywood mindset run amuck .

> meat eater : adventures from the life of an american hunter , by steven rinella , was an uncomfortable read for me . i enjoyed his previous book , american buffalo : in search of a lost icon , a book centered on bison and rinella 's adventures in pursuit of information on this magnificent species . however , meat eater is full of vignettes from rinella 's life that make me wince . he seemed to be raised without a concern about poaching , trespassing , and waste , and the recalled details of his experiences while hunting or trapping at a young age simply can not be believed . although he would hint at the ethical justifications for his interaction with a wide range of species , it ended up seeming shallow . he simply likes to kill and eat things.i did appreciate the detail in his writing . rinella tried to give the reader a real `` taste '' ( pun intended ) of what he does , why he does it , and how it is done . and he brings up valid points regarding sustainability when it comes to wild fish , fowl , and game . but he skirts around the image of 300 million people in the us foraging for their own wild meat . that can not ever happen , of course , or there would n't be wildlife left for rinella.i 'd like to read a review of this book by serious hunters critical of hunting today , like ted kerasote ( bloodties : nature , culture , and the hunt ) or david peterson ( a hunter 's heart : honest essays on blood sport ) .

> `` nova swing '' is a terse , jazz-inflected gem of a space opera science fiction novel from british writer m. john harrison . an exhilarating literary trek replete with references to such familiar motifs as spaceships , androids and alien life intermingled with hard-boiled detective fiction of the kind favored by the likes of chandler , hammett and the early william gibson . however , it is n't cyberpunk , but its own unique literary genre , which nonetheless demonstrates the creative literary potential of classic space opera science fiction . m. john harrison has written a novel truly inspired by its jazz motifs , spinning complex riffs on characters and the strange locale of twisted space and time known as the saudade event site ; the complex geography favored by the novel 's lead protagonist , one vic serotonin , who functions as a `` travel agent '' to and from this bizarre location . harrison demonstrates that he is a superlative prose stylist and spinner of yarns as memorable as any from the likes of china mieville or iain m. banks , two of his fellow distinguished contemporaries in british science fiction . harrison has written a jazz-inflected gem of a novel that deserves ample recognition as among the finest science fiction novels published in the english language during this decade .

> in a matter of minutes after grabbing this book , i already figured how we can save ourselves some $ ... we were getting ready to spend ( on a bassinet ) . we 're already in our eighth month , so we 've already done a lot of the buying ( and baby showers ) for the baby . in many items , we got to some of the same conclusions included in the buying tips . but there are some things that only an `` insider '' can share with you , and the lists that the fields provide ( for options of stores , brands , catalogs , etc . ) are tough to assemble without someone 's expertise ( like theirs ) or a lot of research time invested . these are the tips and insights that make this book pay for itself in a few minutes ! i ca n't believe we were n't recommended this book , just like we were told about the 'classic ' `` what to expect ...

> this is a very beautiful book that almost could have been sub-titled : everything you ever wanted to know about them including what they are , where to find them , what to do with them , and other bits of wisdom too numerous to mention.morels are fungi . one of the organisma that nature uses to help dead plants return their nutrients to the soil . it 's also interesting , biologically speaking , in that it is in the process of evolving from a single celled organism ( a yeast ) into a multicelled organized . this appearantly began about 50,000 years ago.other than that , and regardless of the number of cells they have , morels are delicious . the people who gather them are called schroomers and collecting them is an enjoyable passtime , no collecting them is more like an addiction.this book is a tribute to the fungi , the schroomers , and the eaters . it 's couple of hundred photographs are little less than amazing . if this is your thing , this book will give you many enjoyable moments while you wait for the next collecting season .

> it took awhile ( and lots of money ) to find a cat toy that our cat loves day in and day out - but we found it . this is the only toy that she absolutely obsesses about constantly . we can even hang it from a door and she 'll continue to play with it on her own . and this after owning it for two months now and she 's never been bored by it.it looks like a bug , has a soft body with a little metal stud in the front that creates noise to catch her attention ( and gives weight to the bug so it can be flicked easily ) . feathers add attraction as do the little `` legs ' . what you ca n't see from the picture on amazon is that it is nice and small - about the size of a cicada . so it does the trick perfectly to keep our cat 's interest.we 've spent over a hundred dollars finding toys to keep the cat entertained . this is the winner !

> 1981 's gaucho was the last release the band had until the release of two against nature in 2000. gaucho follows the pop-jazz path of their previous release aja . the album has all the steely dan trademarks : impeccable production , cynical and venomous lyrics and undeniably catchy songs . `` babylon sisters '' opens the album with silky aplomb and then it moves into maybe the best steely dan song , the incredible `` hey nineteen '' . the title track is an underrated song that does n't get enough play and the album closes out with the crisp `` third world man '' . gaucho often gets lost in the shuffle as it followed aja , but it is every bit a good as that album and ranks right up there with anything this great band has released .

> `` i 'll never get out of this world alive '' is steve earle 's most mortal album in a discography that has shaken hands with darkness many a'time . according to his own liner notes , much of the album is written in response to the death of his father , but other forms of grievous loss play throughout the cycle . it begins with the anxious boy in a military town fearing the draft board ( `` waiting for the sky to fall '' ) and ends with a tribute to new orleans ( `` this city '' ) . as per usual , earle 's gruff , passionate voice conveys a richness of emotion that has been his trademark since the days of `` copperhead road . `` i also enjoy the fact that he 's taken some traditional folk/bluegrass forms to play with , like the highwayman who robs for his `` molly'o . '' or that he keeps his political bent on fore with `` little emperor '' and the gulf spill tragedy that follows a families ties to the ocean on `` the gulf of mexico . '' his wife alison moorer adds to an edgy duet called `` heaven or hell , '' which questions the origin of love . it 's all done with the kind of production that t-bone burnette used to excel in , and for a change , burnette does n't bury earle under a mountain of murk . the fact that most of the songs were recorded in a marathon single day session probably helped , but `` ill never get out of this world alive '' marks yet another terrific album from one of america 's last great folksong singer/songwriters .

> many , possibly most of the stories involve dogs - the author speculates that dogs may be the most empathetic of all animals . the first involves a great dane and a fawn - both 'abandoned , ' though the fawn literally so . she grows up and becomes a mother herself , and periodically returns to where she was raised with the dog . then it 's a terrier and a duckling , a girl and a moose ( meet at an alaska wildlife conservation center ) , a dolphin and a sea lion ( australian marine park ) . my favorite was a young boy and his marmot friends in an austrian nature preserve.on to a tortoise and puppies - the tortoise likes the warmth afforded by sleeping among them , and actually likes to eat their food and be with them as well . then its a black cat and an owl that many of us have seen on u-tube - the owner was training the owl to hunt , and the cat just joined in on his own . the most dramatic - a leopard and a dog in an african rehabilitation center.the common denominator seems to be that at least one of the animals was very young when brought into contact with the other ; setting frequently involve nature preserves or animal parks.and best of all - each story is documented with at least one photo , usually several of the two animals .

> 1991 's ceremony is probably the cult 's most overlooked under-appreciated album . unlike the less than stellar self-titled album that followed it , ceremony is a very strong album , and a great representation of the cult 's ever evolving sound.ceremony is by far the cult 's most spiritual album sincedreamtime , while at the same time it retains the harder rocking style ofsonic temple . there are several great songs on this album . `` wild hearted son '' is a great rocker , while `` white '' and the title track are very moving and spiritual . i know some of the synergy that ian astbury and billy duffy had together was lost during the making of this album , but for some reason ceremony just hits a chord in me.ceremony is a great album for any cult fan , no matter what era of the cult 's music you prefer . it may not be on the same level as their 80 's output ( though i think a better overall album thanelectric ) , but it 's much better ( and far more consistent ) than anything they 've released since then.edition notes : ceremony was reissued by beggar 's banquet in 2000 with digitally remastered sound . my only complain with the remastered version is that the packaging was n't as nice as it was on the cult 's previous reissues .

> thought the multiple reviews for this travel accessory have already established this as an excellent adjunct to long airplane rides , not enough has been said about its use in those inevitable airport layovers or rides on trains while touring destinations . the major advantage to this travel pillow is that it takes negligible room in packing - it can even go in your pocket . but when needed this cushiony soft pillow inflates easily and allows for isometric placement of the head for sleeping . it provides neck support and is free of that usual plastic covering that can make other pillows unbearable after an hour or so.but another very fine use for the pillow is its use on ground modes of transportation , whether on the commuter train , bus , or on the hard backed benches in airports . uncomfortable ? need a nap ? just pop out this little warm fuzzy , inflate it with a couple of breathes and doze off in a position that will not leave you with a headache or neck ache . stylish and very comfortably useful and just what you 'd expect from davidsbeenhere travel aids . grady harp , october 12

( i never really trusted those other kinds where a frantic and nervous ball bearing is running around inside some cheap plastic case . ) i highly recommend this pedometer to everyone who is interested in using one , it is well worth the price : the quality is noticeable from the moment you open up the package . my only suggestion is to cover the display window with one of those pda screen protectors ( fellowes , etc ) , if you are a `` scratch freak '' like me .
= excellent product , accurate and easy to use .
< great pedometer

> finally , an affordable kindle . compared to the others , it is lightweight and easy to use . i do not have to connect it to my computer to transfer books from my amazon account . i can also read digital books that i have bought on my computer or my kindle fire . i can buy books and down immediately . instant gratification . i can change the font and font side . it fits easily into my purse and is my portable book i carry with me everywhere . there is no glare and easy to use . the only draw back , it is not a tablet . it is just a book . for me , that was all i wanted a portable book able to carry many books anywhere i go .
= love it !

> i was n't prepared for the poignant writing in ruth reichl 's sequel to her first ( and excellent ) memoir , tender at the bone . in comfort me with apples , reichl indeed needs some comforting . her writing is sure and confident as she opens her heart and her soul to readers who are interested in her adult life , including her years in a berkeley commune , her marriages , love affairs , job history ( she 's editor of gourmet ) , and some terrific recipes along the way . the most difficult and heartbreaking section relates the achingly sad story of her adoption and rearing of a little girl - and then losing her at the last minute when the mother recanted .
= surprisingly touching sequel to tender at the bone
< poignant and comforting

> the biggest problem i have with rowling is that she often pulls a rabit out of a hat . she makes a common mistake of novice writers . she paints her characters into a corner and then suddenly a miracle happens and the problem is resolved . suddenly we fins something major about a character that we never knew before , or some magical rule appears that has never been stated in earlier books.when she get stuck she just sticks in something that fixes it.also her characters do n't act like real people . in addition to constantly arguing with one another , they reacted in illogical ways.once you accept these flaws , the books are well worth the read . very enjoyable .
= then a miracle happens

> `` the day i washed my face in the toilet '' by brenda kearns is a fun read concerning a teenage girl who is plagued by her two eccentric siblings on a family trip to england.the book is full of hilarious episodes and colourful characters . a hyper or slightly autistic brother , the diva sister , a difficult great-aunt or the demented grandmother.besides the comedy however the story touches on some serious issues such as the care for the elderly and what to do with problem children . the book remains light hearted with some uplifting moments and great humour.as with all good young adult fiction there is some food for thought and a message for tolerance and acceptance.highly recommended .
= very entertaining
< fun and funny

> i chose to read this for the naval battle scenes during the civil war . i did not read it to learn about the lover of one of the most menacing pirates toward the union army . the romance part of this story became distracting.while the dialogue at times stole the show , what bothered me were the four scenes going on : once scene in alabama , another scene off the southern coast of africa ( this part i enjoyed ) , another scene in dc ... stop it already ! but i understand why the scenes are necessary for a war battle.had there been tighter editing this could have been such a good read .
= take out the romance and it 's a good read !

> i 've always loved eden 's garden for its fair prices on quite decent oils , though this one leaves me slightly disappointed , it not striking me quite as high quality as other ylang ylang oils . this may be a moment where you are getting the bargain deal here , though this still remains a fine oil and not the worst it could be.the aroma is quite fragrant and flowery , and by inhalation i feel the effects almost immediately . i find it a wonderful mood enhancer and great for baths and showers .

> my wife tends to go through chargers as she sits in bed with the computer charging and invariably the cords twist and bye , bye charger . gets tired real quick going to the apple store for a replacement . this one works well with her macbook pro and if it breaks at least it is n't an arm and a leg to replace . the charger is well built and does not overheat which is a good thing as it is left plugged in 24/7 .

> only watched the first episode , but realized where the show is heading . show could have done more to portray actors better when they were younger as well as they style of clothes worn in the 80 's . the plot seems good , but story not compelling since everything fits neatly at the end .

> this is a very short regency story about a widow and a widower in unusual circumstances.reggie 's wife and clara 's husband betrayed them -- with each other . when they died ( in kind of unclear circumstances ) , reggie took clara under his wing to help her weather the scandal . clara is pregnant with her late husband 's child , but reggie ca n't deny his feelings for her . all of this takes place before the story even begins , so it is not surprising that the author has difficult working in the back story gracefully . it 's a novella length story that the author tries to dispose of in a couple of paragraphs.neither of the main characters come across as true products of their time . other than a couple of period terms , these two are modern people plopped in a historical situation and that , aside from the unusually rushed feel of the plot , was the main thing that kept me from enjoying the story . reggie 's attitude and decisions were n't plausible and we did n't have enough time with him to fully believe that he was willing to throw away everything that would have been important to a man of his era . clara did n't seem to have a core personality at all.this may be a great author ( she certainly seems to have some loyal fans ) , but i think she needs a longer format to work her magic .

> this album is almost an afterthought in that it was recorded during the time thatinterplaywas being recorded ( july through august 1962 ) . the tracks here were recorded with a slightly different line-up during those new york sessions on august 21 and 22.the sound samples on this page will tell you if this album is for you . frankly many fans are so invested in bill 's trio recordings that they dislike the quintet format . i am not one of them . i love this album for a number of reasons , foremost among them is i am a fan of every musician on these tracks . however , that is my personal take and is highly subjective . listen to the sound samples and let your ears guide you.musicians here are bill backed by zoot sims on tenor sax ( and one of my favorites ) , jim hall and philly joe jones from the interplay album , and ron carter on bass ( replacing percy heath who was the bassist on interplay . ) the great news is that - at the time of this review - you can get this and interplay on a double album set that is priced less than this album alone : interplay sessions . so if you like what you hear in the sound samples , check that album out before making a final purchase decision .
= part of the quintet sessions from 1962

> this book started as a website for people to write letters to their former teenage selves . what a wonderful idea ! the book led me to think about what i would say to my past self , and i enjoyed the camaraderie of other past teenagers -- we are not alone in our humiliation and uncertainty ! also , i am the mother of teenagers , so i find this valuable as a way to talk to them about the things they 're going through , too , and to put things in perspective.these letters , one to two pages , are written by all different people , so as you can imagine there are many approaches . some are whimsical , some are funny , others are rather heartbreaking . some authors try to warn themselves , some tell themselves to relax -- it will all be okay . there 's a wide range of ideas gathered around this interesting premise . this is a nice collection of thoughtful and insightful essays , entertaining but thought provoking too . of interest to those looking back at their teenage years or those living them.a sequel -- writing to your future self ?
= great concept , lovely writing

> steve berry has written a well researched thriller that is sure to be one of his best . the templar subject seems to be popular this year as raymond khoury 's 'the last templar ' ( which i highly recommend ) came out earlier this year . both novels basically cover the same storyline and both do a darn good job . khoury 's is paced a little faster throughout and berry 's is a little more in depth and not so fast , except at the beginning and the last quarter.this is still a well put together novel that i know all dan brown fans would love.from inside : `` the gnostic gospels were extraordinary texts , many scholars now say the gospel of thomas , which was included in them , may be the closest we have to christ 's actual words . the early christians were terrified of the gnostics . the word came from the greek gnosis , which meant 'knowledge ' . gnostics were simply people in the know , but the emerging catholic version of christianity eventually eliminated all gnostic thought and teachings . `` highly recommended .

> this album by queen was released in 1989. it was their first album to dispense with individual songwriting credits . all four group members are credited on all the songs , whether they actually had a hand in the writing or not . queen 's popularity in the us was way down at this point . the only single from the album to make the american pop charts was `` i want it all '' , which peaked at a meager # 50 on the hot 100. however , queen remained tremendously popular in the rest of the world . five songs from this album were hits in the uk . `` i want it all '' reached # 3 , `` breakthru '' reached # 7 , `` the invisible man '' peaked at # 12 , `` scandal '' reached # 25 and `` the miracle '' topped out at # 21. overall , this is a very good album , although the lack of recognizable us hits may make it less popular with american listeners .

> i 've never had a sprinkler this nice . i am still baffled about how far this thing can cover in a yard ! if you have a newly seeded or sodded yard , be sure to order this guy . you can set it up on a tripod too and even get more coverage . we 're putting a splitter on the hose and using two of these per hose to carry enough to cover 1/2 acre and by far , these dramm sprinklers do the best job of both saturating the sod , and covering a large area.in addition , you can change the settings to suit a smaller area too , like a flower bed , which we have done as well . so much easier than just standing there watering each plant ! hands down , a great buy and i can definitely see why so many people love dramm 's products . made of steel too so even when dropped , it holds up to the job . highly , highly recommend !
= super durable , cool sprinkler !
< great sprinkler !

> this short work telling of the death of a child in the shoah , and the subsequent life- destroying effect on the mother of the child is a disturbing and moving one . the symbolic 'shawl ' connects the two parts of the work . it had helped keep baby magda alive in a concentration camp , , and fifty years later the mother rosa holds on to as if it contained within it the life of her dead baby . ozick 's writing is brilliant especially in her depiction of the aging survivors in miami . a note of hope enters in the figure of an elderly suitor persky who attempts to woo rosa back to a life of her own . but as ozick makes painfully clear the message of rosa 's life is that what has been most loved in the past is far more real than any present or future can be .

> i strongly disagree with david hurwitz 's abysmal review of this cd . i believe this is one of the finest recordings karajan and the berlin philharmonic ever made of brahms ' 1st symphony . the same can be said for schumann 's 1st symphony too . karajan had a fine understanding of brahms ' and schumann 's rich orchestral textures at this time ; both performances are vibrant , and exhilirating , filled with the warm ambience you 'd expect from the berlin philharmonic 's string and wind sections . karajan was a perfectionist with regards to sound quality . that 's why he recorded these symphonies , as well as beethoven 's , several times . yet these earlier recordings hold up better than this later ones if only because his conducting became less inspiring towards the end of his career . karajan fans will certainly want to add this cd to their collection .

> i am always pleasantly surprised when i find a book by a new author and buy it on a whim , then find that it is quite enjoyable . that 's what happened with this book , and it was an excellent purchase on my part . for a first-time author , ms.mcmahon has a deft narrative touch , and gives her characters a real backstory while moving forward with the plot . this book is many things : a murder mystery , a ghost story , a coming-of-age novel , and a tale of the relationship between a daughter and her ill mother . the writing was crisp , and encouraged continuous page-turning so that i could get to the end and have all of the loose ends tied up , which they were . i look forward to future works from this talented author .

> i 've been using a philips sonicare electronic toothbrush religiously for the last two years and the state of my gums has improved immensely . i no longer get lectures about the proper way to brush or hear dire warnings about gingivitis at the dentist 's office . this latest model is n't too much different than last year 's though there are a few minor upgrades and all of the sonicare brand toothbrushes are fine dental hygiene products worth their high price . but you still have to floss ! though my gums got a good report at my last dentist visit they did discover the first cavity i 've had in years between two back molars which my dentist asserts could have been prevented by thorough flossing . my teeth feel so clean after a sonicare brushing i sometimes neglect the flossing step .

> if you are a true believer this book will be a true inspiration . a lot of the one star reviewers are atheists trying to undermine the christian faith . the important thing to remember is the boy was not even four years old when he visited heaven . how would he know to ask jesus about a cure for cancer , as one reviewer suggested ? of course it is going to have his father 's slant on it -- he wrote the book , and just recorded his observations . a lot of the concepts the little boy talks about experiencing are way too complex for him to have made them up . i actually think the reason people gave this book a one-star rating is they do not want others to read this book and know the truth .

> a good book , the immortal game walks the reader through the game of chess from its ancient beginnings to modern times . not exactly an academic study it is nonetheless discusses chess not just from an historical point of view but also from a psychological standpoint . i liked the graphic near the beginning of the book which illustrated chess as played by the muslims during the height of islam but it does not do the same for chess as played before the creation of the chess queen or other variants played in europe before standardization . still , a neat book and if you 've played the game it will make you look at chess in a new way .

> this is a collection of 65 tv themes from the '70s and '80s . they all seem to be the original versions of the themes , unlike some of the earlier volumes in the series , which had some rerecordings . these are the tv shows i grew up with , so there is a lot of nostalgia here for me . i like the sitcom themes the best , because that is mostly what i watched when i was a kid . a lot of them are really cheesy , but i love 'em . if you watched too much tv during the '70s and '80s , you will probably get a kick out of this cd .

> the bottom line : if you 're one of the people who hates when people portray the 1950 's as a halcyon age where everyone skipped merrily along ( as long as you were white ! ) grooving to rock and roll , watch far from heaven , a recreation of douglas sirk 's style of filmmaking that follows a prototypical 50 's housewife as she discovers that her husband has homosexual tendencies and that she 's attracted to a black man ; it may be a bit overpraised in some quarters but it 's a fine film and a worthy watch.3/4

> when blayne first met bo ten years ago , he made such an impression on her but not necessarily a favorable one . in fact , she is a bit apprehensive about the fact that he just may be the man she needs to help her career . to be the best she can be in her shifter roller derby style sport , she needs some lessons from the man himself.polar bears and wolf-dogs do n't usually make a good match . but bo ca n't seem to keep from wanting to protect blayne , as much as she annoys him , and is messing up his routine . especially when he realizes that they are really meant to be together forever.now , suddenly someone seems to be stalking blayne . this is not something that a polar bear can tolerate . so even if it means kidnapping and dragging her cute little butt of to maine , that is what he will do . no one is going to use his mate in a shifter dogfight , and she is going to realize they are meant to be together.beast behaving badly is another action packed chemistry ridden adventure by ms. laurenston . i love the way ms. laurenston has blayne get beneath bo 's defenses and even makes him a little crazy in the process . overall , i love the idea of the two of these characters together . additionally , i was cheering to find out part of the story would be set in my home state of maine . yeah for maine ! i think bo and blayne are a perfect yin/yang couple and am glad to see them together . ms. laurenston did a wonderful job in creating their chemistry and the suspense behind her stalker etc ... i loved the story . i think all you fans of shifter stories and ms. laurenston will agree that beast behaving badly is another winner .

> a long , long time ago , when there were doves and hawks , straights and hippies , and am and fm , gary pucket and king crimson , you were not supposed to like the 5th if you were anywhere left of the white album . you could hear `` up up and away , '' or `` paper cup '' on the radio , and you would secretly like it , but had to keep this close to your vest.and you liked it because most of this music is really great . the 5d managed to combign their cherry-sweet vocals with great songwriting ( jimmy web , laura nyro ) and crack wrecking crew players ( hal blane , joe osborn . ) the result is the perfect chemistry that creates great pop music.any one of the songs on disc one is like a vitiman -- a few per day and you 'll feel a lot better . plus , there is a lot more to the music than first meets the ear . just listen to the 2nd half of `` aquarius/let the sunshine in . '' sure , it is great top 40 music , but listen to the band : they rock right up there with james brown or the stones . ( slow it down and play the jam as metel . it would be a mosh pit smash ) after 1970 , the band did tone it down and did get a little to deep into mor ballads . this is covered on disc two , which is not all that bad but not all that interesing.but disc one makes this well worth listening to.now , excuse me , but i have some blue cheer to listen to .

> when reo speedwagon released hi infidelity in early 1981 , they had been recording and releasing albums for over a decade . they had enjoyed some moderate chart success , but were a big draw on the concert circuit especially in their native midwest . the years of hard work paid off because this album skyrocketed to number one and helped reo become an & quot ; overnight success & quot ; story . by combining uptempo rock songs with power ballads , hi infidelity has something for everybody . the album opens with the keyboard-driven & quot ; do n't let him go & quot ; and then moves into one of the ultimate power ballads & quot ; keep on loving you & quot ; ( the album 's lone number one single ) which starts off slow and builds into a lighter-flicking crescendo . & quot ; follow my heart & quot ; and & quot ; in your letter & quot ; are both good songs and & quot ; take it on the run & quot ; was a top ten hit . & quot ; tough guys & quot ; opens up with a snippet of dialogue from the little rascals and is a ballsy rocker . the album closes out with another ballad & quot ; i wish you were there & quot ; . reo continued to enjoy chart success throughout the 80 's before getting swept out with the rest of the 80 's rockers in the grunge explosion , but they never were able to record another album that matched hi infidelity 's cohesiveness and quality or match it chart success .

> this movie novelization works a bit better than the movie it is based on . this is in part because the author is more familiar with the subject than the makers of the movie . for instance , instead of allowing nemo to say , `` i call it an automobile . '' the author points out that at that time benz was already cranking out cars and ford had devised the model t. thus it is added how nemo improved on existing designs . there are other moments like this where minor problems are corrected.unfortunately the novelization has to hold true to the film so most of the real problems with the film adaptation are still present . alan moore 's league is greatly changed from their original comic appearance and their literary appearances . here the league is up against a madman bent of plunging the entire world into war in hopes of ruling it all . the league chases the villain around the world while suffering many setbacks until all is played out.well written with nice additions . it is too bad it had to follow the movie script as the author could have done more with the story . still , if you can handle the story , the novelization is very well written .

> this sequel to the mini-series `` dune '' combines action from frank herbert 's novels `` dune messiah '' and `` children of dune .

> john wayne 's first important screen appearance , this raoul walsh picture about a wagon train crossing the plains is quite a major production for its day . much longer than most pictures of the time ( though for some unknown reason shortened by 20 minutes on this dvd release , an unfortunate decision disparaged by other reviewers here ) , the movie tells a vivid story with the camera . there is n't much plot , but various incidents - a buffalo hunt , an indian attack , a near-disastrous crossing of a rain-swollen stream - are all captured wonderfully on film . unfortunately , the spotlight that shined so brightly on wayne here flicked out after the picture was released , and he would be relegated to churning out numerous quick oaters and action flicks for the next nine years before getting another big break in stagecoach . maybe fox or somebody will do this picture the justice it deserves and put the whole thing out on dvd so we can get rid of this edited version once and for all .

> that well describes this book , & quot ; recognizable food raised to a gourmet level. & quot ; if you 're like me who has and reads lots of cookbooks , the recipes here are n't that unique , but they are done with a great deal of sophistication and style , each intensely packed with flavor and presented with class.in he intro she provides her cuisine approach : & quot ; food is not about impressing people . in fact , it 's just the opposite : it 's about making them feel comfortable . i invite friends to lunch and make bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwiches . they are the best blt 's i can make. & quot ; a great approach we all can abide by with our guests . nonetheless , there are other cookbooks when we like to challenge ourselves and reach out a little and do something different.recipes especially fond of serving include : roasted vegetable torte ; shortbread hearts ; pecan shortbread ; potato-fennel gratin ; sun-dried tomato dip .

> this book is like nothing i have ever read before . it is written from the point of view of the angel of death during the time of the holocaust in germany . ostensibly about a young girl displaced by the war and taken in by a foster family and her life there , it manages to portray the small , day to day experiences and effects on people still trying to live their lives in those terribly distorted times . it shows one girls struggle to grow up and her passion for books , and - it is truly remarkable book , in my opinion.i have not seen the movie . i always prefer to read first and view second . so i have no idea how they could take this subtle , complex , horrifying and yet fantastic book to screen . my imagination , however , was able to handle easily all the complexities.it was , in my opinion , one of the truly outstanding books i have ever read about the holocaust times .

> since gary larson retired and stopped creating new farside comics , there have been a plethora of artists who have tried to fill the void , albeit unsuccessfully . however , the comics desire to find another farside might finally be over with the arrival of the argyle sweater . originally created for the internet by scott hillburn , the argyle sweater is the closest comic like farside since , well farside . the argyle sweater is similar to farside in both the style of humor and the style of drawing . like farside , the strips are each one panel and most really heavily both on witty wordplay as well as humorous visuals . there are some strips that are n't as funny as others , but the majority of the strips are quite humorous . the argyle sweater is the first collection of hillburn 's strip and though it 's not quite as strong as farside , it has a lot of potential and i look forward to reading further collections of the series .

> it was great to pick up with the characters from a time to kill . jake , harry rex , ozzie , lucien , and carla are warm , comfortable and pleasingly familiar . it is three years after the case that cemented jake 's reputation as a skilled litigator . while his notoriety is strong , his bank account is weak . such is the reality of small town lawyering . then a case falls in his lap involving the will of a gentleman that has taken his own life.we are then treated to a course on wills and estates as only grisham can do . nothing is straightforward and a part of the south 's ugly past plays an important role . i thoroughly enjoyed the book until it moved into the courtroom . then it became procedural . most disappointing was the resolution that watered down the book 's opening and premise . still it entertains and moves at a great clip . grisham always ensures that justice is done .

> newburyport , massachusetts undertoad newspaper editor tom ryan hiked several new hampshire mountains with his brothers . when his friend vicki pearson died from cancer , tom felt a need to honor her . he closed his paper and decided to climb all forty-eight peaks in the white mountains to raise money for charity in vicki 's name . when his schnauzer max died , tom obtained an unwanted schnauzer pup atticus maxwell finch who joined him on the trek of climbing the 48 in 90 days.this is a fascinating poignant memoir that passionately focuses on much more than just a man and a dog in booties bonding while climbing mountains . instead tom ryan discusses his estrangement with his late opinionated dad that has left him feeling regret , but between the mountains and his heroic canine , he felt a spiritual enlightenment that has given his pre climbing tortured soul tranquility . this is a super biography of a troubled man finding solace by following atticus ' lead to nirvana.harriet klausner

> while lacking in the humor and warmth that the southern vampire series has , this first entry in harris ' potential new series was still a page-turner . at least after the first two chapters were over , that is . the heroine of the story has the power to 'listen to the dead ' and finds bodies of deceased people by following their call . an interesting idea , and one that i was n't sure could hold up over an entire novel . to harris ' credit , she pulled off the mystery , and was wise enough to keep it under 300 pages . i was intrigued enough to read the whole book , but found plenty of material skippable , especially near the end , which seemed padded with extra details.i will try another book in the series if one comes out , but wo n't be disappointed if it does n't .

> i 've had luck with other sennheiser headphones ( in particular , i love the wired hd 555 headphones ) , but these wireless ones are just awful.there is a hiss on all channels , even at close range , and in a home with no other interference.worse , though , is the fact that they wo n't stay on my head ! the flat ear pieces lay flat , rather than hooking around the ears , so they just slide off your ears when you tilt your head forward or back . and the bar that rests on the top of your head is horrible also ... even on it 's tightest setting it is loose on a medium-sized head , and the padding provides no friction . these headphones really want to slide off my head . definitely returning them .

> if you 're looking for a case that is n't too bulky and protects well , i 'd say this is worth the money . plus the price here is unbeatable . the yellow and gray are a great combo . this case does n't have a built-in screen protector ( which i personally like ) , but it does come with the stick on screen protector.i noticed some reviewers commenting that they received a fake otterbox or that the silicon skin and polycarbonate outer shell did not fit together properly . the product i received was a new , genuine otterbox in the original packaging . the two pieces fit together and on my phone perfectly . i usually buy speck products , but i would definitely recommend this commuter case to others .

> wow , maybe i 'm just not the right person for this book . maybe the plot is interesting - but the writing is awful . could be the translator 's fault , but i doubt it . the endless , overly detailed descriptions of items is really annoying . i do n't care what brand tape recorder , scanner , or computer the subjects use . it does not advance the plot and just gets annoying . why is it there ? second , the characters are utterly unbelievable . the idea that lisbeth would be so bright in investigation and research and not apply any of those skills to her own situation is absurd.frankly , this was one of the worst books i 've ever read .

> the best thing about bud not buddy is the portrait it paints of life during the great depression . freight train hopping , hoovervilles , bread lines , labor organizers , jazz bands and other components of the 1930 's are all given a place . the plot is basically a journey as the orphaned buddy makes his way from the children 's welfare system to being united with a long missing relative with some adventures along the way . good choice for upper elementary and middle school students looking for a historical or multicultural novel .

> it seems that there are different types of hoarding behavior , that it is not well understood even by professionals , and that treatment is difficult . anyone who either is a hoarder or who knows one will find insightful information here as well as lots of questions but few definitive answers . however , it is sometimes very comforting simply to know that there are others out there sharing the same experiences and problems and this book certainly fills that need.where `` stuff '' falls short is as a useful academic resource , having a reference list but no footnotes and neither a detailed table of contents nor an index . most of the information , though drawn from years of professional experience working with hoarders , is anecdotal . there is simply not a great depth of true scientific understanding of this disorder and its treatment . one therapist even excludes hoarders from her ocd patient therapy outcome studies because they make her therapy look bad ! on the other hand , this is also the book 's strong point as entertainment in that it presents a range of different types of hoarders with much more social and psychological depth and detail than is possible on a television show segment . the case of the cat hoarding cult alone makes this book worth reading ! although the hoarding environments are described in delicious detail , they are not illustrated with photographs , so anyone craving visual hoarding porn should look elsewhere.all-in-all , this is a very good book for those whose interests lie somewhere between researching and gawking , certainly appropriate and enjoyable for those non-professionals who want to increase their understanding of this disorder , and definitely interesting reading .

> as an inveterate beatles ' fan , i was naturally interested in reading one of , if not the first biography of former beatle george harrison shortly after his untimely death in 2001.instead of being a comprehensive work that focused on the man 's artistic accomplishments , this book fell back on tired cliches such as `` the quiet beatle , '' and `` the youngest beatle . '' very little new material is provided in this book . i did not feel it ranked among the better beatle biographies . the selection of photographs were good and i liked the few tidbits about olivia arias , the late artist 's widow.since this book came out just a scant few months after the late beatle 's demise , one can not help but wonder if the timing of its publication is yet another way to cash in on the beatles ' fame . since george harrison is no longer living in the material world , his input remains unknown . this work is certainly not one i would give a ringing endorsement , but it did hold my interest because of the subject.at best this is a good starter book for people who want a `` quick fix '' in learning the basics of george harrison 's life . at worst , it is a mediocre work with little news to offer .
= mediocre - all things must pass this book

> in omar tyree 's what they want , he introduces readers to terrance mitchell , a male model who has enjoyed success and longevity in his career . while this is the case professionally , terrance has n't proven to be in for the long haul in any of his romantic relationships . he 's free to spread his love around to whichever lady piques his interest , and he has no responsibilities to anyone other than himself . that 's the way he likes it . through a series of women , blasts from his past , and wild sexual escapades , terrance 's view on women and men and their relationships with one another shifts.what they want has plenty of sex and drama , providing a fair amount of entertainment and shock value ; but , at times , it seemed like it was thrown in just for the heck of it , rather than providing information or insight about the characters . however , i was intrigued and entertained by terrance 's character . his evolution and struggles were believable and interesting . i think i know where tyree wanted to drive this novel , but some of the extraneous hoopla seemed to take the focus away from that main point.reviewed by candacekof the rawsistaz reviewers

> this feature animation consists of five or ten regular cartoons starring bugs , daffy , or the roadrunner . they 're glued together into some semblance of a unit with a new outer story : bugs , after a wildly successful career , is in retirement . he is interviewed ... the cartoons are all good ones , but their original titles are not given . one of my favorites , i think it 's called `` what 's opera , doc ? '' pits elmer fudd against bugs in wagnerian drama - it 's a howl . bugs , daffy duck , elmer and porky pig appear in a few combinations , with cameos by marvin the martian ( a personal favorite ) . the whole set ends up with roadrunner taunting wile e. coyote into new realms of improbable physics.one charming feature was that mel blanc voiced the interlude pieces relatively late in his life . i could hear a little age creeping into his voice . it was very appropriate to the retired bugs bunny , but a little sad too.it 's good goofy fun . the assembly is a bit forced , but the individual ` toons are part of how my generation grew up.//wiredweird

> this is a great book , and i do n't mean to put it down . my problem with this title was the formatting . for one reason or another , on my kindle fire the text started and ended in weird places and the size of the text went through some dramatic changes as well . i do n't know if this is something that happened when the book downloaded or if it just a kindle fire thing . either way , beyond that , i found this to be a well written and informative book that will teach your kids a lot about the chosen subject . i thought the pictures looked great and was glad the author included closeups for the child to inspect . even with the formatting issues , the book was fun for my kids and i was grateful that they learned a lot by the end of the book . i think a lot of the time bees are mistaken as villains and i was glad my kids had the opportunity to see how useful they really are . really nice book for kids .

> i remember reading this book when i was elementary school . the passages about all of the animals in their preparation for winter fascinated me . i grew up in iowa , so harsh winters were the norm . my father was a hunter so we often dined on game . however , like so many hunters , he was also very aware of the need for wildlife to survive the winter , so he fed the local squirrels and birds . which is the point of the last few pages of this book , where the only two people mentioned throw feed out for all the animals that forage during the winter months.the lessons of the animals preparing for the coming winter and the humans putting out feed are ones that i read about in this book and observed first hand . they are timeless lessons , and even though it was written over a half century ago , this book is still a worthy addition to any child 's library .

> i just got back from a safari to uganda and kenya and found this to be perhaps the most useful book of the small library i brought with me . when you 're on a safari , you want something that is small , light , and informative . this book is all three of those things . i could easily fit it in my backpack without adding much weight . it is fairly comprehensive , covering birds , mammals , reptiles , amphibians , and plants . it usually has two good photos for each species , allowing for easy identification . one of the features i really liked is that the lefthand margin of each page is left blank . intentionally or not , this proved really useful as an area to write the date of when you spotted that particular animal or other notes . i checked off each species i saw and wrote the date beside it , which i am now using as i go through my photos and try to identify them all . perhaps the best compliment i can give this book is that it came home more bent up and dirtier from such frequent use than any of my other books.the only drawback to the book is that does not contain every important species you might see on your trip . i 'd say it covers maybe 95 % of the animals you 're likely to see , but i also found the missing 5 % to be frustrating . for example , it does n't have the great blue turaco or the shoebill , beautiful birds that i saw in uganda . for the former , i can perhaps understand since the great blue turaco 's range in east africa is limited to the westernmost portions . still , i hope future editions of the book include even more wildlife .
= small , light , and useful !

> my review : i am going to start my review with the fact that this was one of my first books of this kind . i was kinda of amazed that i really liked it.author suzanne collins is an amazing writer . the descriptions , characters and the things that happened in this book caught my attention and held it from the beginning to the end . could not wait to get my hands on the next book . i actually went out that evening late , which is something i do not do and went to wal-mart and bought catching fire and mocking jay . did not want to wait.if you have read this one , tell me : why does katniss need to make her face `` an indifferent mask '' and be careful what she says in public ? katniss 's relationship between gale and prim and with her mother is really interesting . she is just a kind of daughter any one would be proud of.i do not want to give any thing away . so i am not going to get into much of the book . but to know that you well be on camera always as a tribute would be crazy for me . then the games , wow is all i will say here . you need to really read . just imagine if this really could take place , what or how would you feel ? this book was my own . and this is my honest opinion of the book and author.so for the reasons above . i am giving this book my breath of life rating of : five clock rating ! ! !

> i 've taken to listening to podcasts and audiobooks . time in the shower is as good or better than any other time for this activity , but my tablet did n't produce quite enough volume for my aging ears.so i got myself a sound pop - and very pleased with it.it charges quickly from a laptop usb port , though i would strongly urge that you pack a 5v adapter if you travel with the sound pop . happily , you can use the sound pop while it is charging , a major plus in my book.the sound from the sound pop is surprisingly good . spoken voice reproduction is simply excellent . the voices sound natural without the tinniness so often heard in laptop speakers and cheap external speakers . music sounds good , though it lacks extreme bass and treble.output volume is also unexpectedly good . it 's loud enough for listening in a good sized , reasonably quiet room . some motel room heater/air conditioners will easily drown it out.bluetooth pairing was flawless and quick . the sound pop can only be paired with one device at a time . reception started breaking up in about 20 feet as i moved through our home.i did n't fully test out the cell phone controls , but i did test the unit microphone with skype and it produced good quality output at adequate volume.overall , an excellent unit at a good price . works fine for its intended purpose in the shower as well as elsewhere . i like it.jerry

> `` willow 's '' story is a curious blend of tolkien-style images -- two races , gender shifts from _bible_ tales , and `` snow white . '' the evil queen bavmorda ( jean marsh ) seeks to purge her realm of all girl babies because one will come to supplant her power.a nursemaid manages to hide a baby-girl born and secret her in a basket on the river . the infant is found by nelwyn ( dwarf ) willow ufgood ( warwick davis ) who reluctantly becomes her guardian to take her to safety . mad mardigan ( van kilmer ) signs on as the daikini ( human size ) bodyguard.the story 's interesting if a little slow at times . `` willow 's '' world clearly is not as well realized as tolkien 's , but tolkien took many years to complete his works . the scenery -- a combination of great britain and new zealand -- is beautiful . acting is so-so.there are portions of the movie , monsters , swordfights , etc . that may not be appropriate for the smaller children in the audience . parental attention to how upset the kids will be over scary creatures , etc . is advised.while this is a a good movie for a first- or second-time viewing , i 'm not sure anyone but hard-core fantasy movie lovers or children 's film fans would want `` willow '' in their collections .

> former minor league ballplayer , ron shelton crafted a funny , sentimental and romantic comedy based around a minor league baseball team , the durham bulls . the film uses baseball as a backdrop for a love triangle between a local lady , a career minor league and a young phenom . kevin costner stars as crash davis , a savvy veteran catcher who dispenses his wisdom on a young fireballer nuke lalush played by tim robbins . between the two of them is annie played by susan sarandon . every season she picks a player who she dates for the season and dispenses her own brand of wisdom . the film is full of rich and humorous dialogue and unlike most baseball films , offers a fairly realistic look at the game . mr. costner has never been better than in this film , where his everyman persona is perfect . he knows his career is winding down and he 'll never fully realize his baseball dreams , but he can give back to the game he loves by helping the ignorant nuke . mr. robbins became a star with his hilarious turn as the goofball nuke and ms. sarandon simmers in her lusty role . comedian robert wuhl garnered attention as a cliche spewing bench coach . bull durham is an immensely enjoyable , well made comedy that will appeal to a more mature sense of humor .

> wow ! i just finished reading this book . now i can get back to my other duties in life . this is the first book i have read in its entirety on kindle . i tried one other ( 'let 's take the long way home ' ) , but the author was a little too self-focused for my taste . with this book , on the other hand , i took advantage of every opportunity to read it . this meant staying up late at night , catching a few pages when i could , and carrying the kindle with me everywhere i went . the book flowed well , such that even when the author was covering the mundane , it was not boring or tedious . the events leading to the end had me clicking through the pages as quickly as i could . there is some disturbing content in the book , but the author did n't get out of hand with it.so , i give the book 5 stars and am definitely glad i took the time to read it . i guess i 'm now devoted to kindle , though i love the feel of a book . oh well .

> the last harry potter was very , very well thoughtout , and i was scared to read it at first in fear that too many people will die who are main characters , and even though people did die , it was very reasonable and i understood it had to be done , though it was saddening . it was complicated but i love the way harry won victory , and the truth was finally revealed , and all your questions were answered . a great book , and i love how rowling wrote it . spellbinding and wonderful . rowling has such a big imagination that you will come to admire in all harry potter books , but especially in this one . to me , this was my favorite harry potter book and i felt like hugging it after reading it . a long but worhtwhile read ! words ca n't express my admiration for rowling ! i love harry potter !

> season 5 of star trek voyager has some good episodes , but it 's also clear the show has become the `` seven and doctor show '' . jeri ryan as seven of nine and robert picardo as the doctor consistently get the best dialogue , perform the best acting , and star in the best episodes . kate mulgrew as captain janeway also gets consistently strong characterization , but the rest of the crew seems like they fell by the wayside.season 5 started out with a really interesting premise , with janeway in depression and the crew traveling through a starless void . this is exactly what i 'd hoped to see more of in voyager - the crew going through psychological stress on their voyage home . however , this tension only lasts for one episode before we get back to business as usual . what a wasted opportunity .

> jack nicholson as randle mcmurphy who is sent to a mental institution for observation ; he ends up getting some of the patients to assert themselves more than they ever have before . most of the patients are `` volunteer '' patients , afraid of the outside world ; nicholson shakes them up and gives them some confidence . but when he attacks the head nurse after she `` psychologically '' maltreats a boy , he is given shock treatment until he 's just about a vegetable . the movie is a powerful blend of comedy and institutional horror ; it 's a tour-de-force performance for nicholson . the movie won all 5 top oscars . it 's a great tribute to the human spirit.this 2-disc special edition contains an excellent documentary about the movie 's creation along with other terrific extras . this is the dvd to get .

> surrealistic pillow , is a masterpiece of great song writing and playing . it had a folky acid rock feel to it . this one was straight acid rock basically and that means a lot of spacey songs . it 's looser and less tight . which is ok for a band to do , but thankfully they got much tighter with their next release as the record buying public found this one lacking in many ways . i like it , but then i like acid rock , but even i prefer well crafted tight discs with some meandering songs , instead of lots of meandering songs ! that being said , this was a master group and they knew how to do a acid rock disc . i enjoy this one , but casual fans should stick to other releases which are all tighter in format probably .

> the unseen depression cure is an impressive take action guide that focuses on numerous important factors of depression , including prevention . the author does an excellent job opening the mind to look into what action steps can be taken , rather than all the inevitables that go hand in hand with this mental illness.it 's delivered in an engaging and light hearted manner that is often humorous . i ca n't believe thomson 's 50 and has n't had sex yet ! lolbottom line is this is a useful and well versed guide that offers solutions . my recommendation is you give it a read and let the author know what you gained . great guide !

> james patterson tells us with some enthusiasm , because this book is important to him , that the volume contains three stories : his own tale of how he wrote his history , the adventure of the eccentric howard carter who discovered king tut 's grave , and the life of king tut and his death . patterson states that he is certain that tut was murdered and promises to reveal the murderer.he writes that he will tell us the truth . `` it 's nothing new for histories to be speculative , but there 's a difference between guessing and basing a theory on cold facts . we chose the facts . `` some readers may agree that there are facts in the book , but still feel that the bulk is pure speculation . for example , the authors describe how one pharaoh died while having sex and gives a description of king tut 's sexual experience on his wedding night . these episodes add drama , but they are certainly not based on facts.other readers may question whether he overcame the general scientific view that tut died from infections that followed a fall . they may also be unconvinced that the murderer ( s ) - i do not want to reveal if it was a he or she or more than one - was/were who he identified . patterson presents no evidence to support either assertion.still others will recognize that despite the claim that this is `` a non-fiction thriller , '' it is actually historical fiction . others may even claim that it is historical fiction lite . however , despite these criticisms , the book is entertaining and does give us , as does all historical fiction , a sense of a time and people who we should know something about .

> there is a new & quot ; school ' of female singer/songwriters out there today , lead ( in measures of success ) by jewel , sheryl crow and even shelby lynne . however , there are many others , lesser known but in many respects more engaging , including miranda lee richards , nikka costa , shea seger and yes , leona naess.on & quot ; i tried to rock you but you only roll & quot ; ( is it just me , but i find that a rather annoying and akward title for the album ) , leona shows us how much she has matured since her debut album & quot ; comatised & quot ; . the opening track & quot ; mexico & quot ; ( not to be confused with the james taylor song of the same name ) sets the tone for the entire album : a mid-tempo song about asking a former lover to come along to mexico ( & quot ; we can laugh about the love we used to know ... . i should hate you but i do n't , you should love me but you wont & quot ; ) . & quot ; all the stars & quot ; reminded me of some old donna summer tune . the title track is a smart pop song , a couda-shoulda-been radio hit . other standouts are & quot ; blue eyed baby & quot ; and the very strong & quot ; panic-stricken & quot ; .leona naess 's second album is full of quality songs . with the teen pop craze finally starting to fizzle out , maybe radio will find room for albums such as this . for those of you already familiar with leona , you will not be disappointed !

> i chose this book to read as it sounded very promising and intriguing . however looks can be deceiving . while i did like the idea of the story , i found the characters dull and the story boring ( lacking in any action ) . the story was all over the place without really any good explanation . for example , eva is racing along in the cold wilderness as part of the testing and when she reaches the rest point one of her biggest competitors and suppose love interest , jasper has already arrived . eva wonders how he arrived before her as she never saw him once while she was racing hundreds of miles in the snow . yet she drops it without a second thought . really ? ! then a mysterious man comes to eva 's aid but his identity is not revealed until later . oh and there is the world that eva is living in . it is suppose to be the new modern age in finland but there is no concrete explanation as to why or how the people got there . the artifacts are to be a great discovery but eva finds a picture of a ballerina and her body . proving that the ballerina never made it to her destination and her love . finally throw in the mix of the bible and baby jesus . this book is nothing like game of thrones or hunger games and should not be compared to either book . ugh .

> i can see how people , especially longtime journey fans , could have a problem with the red 13 ep . it 's definitely a step away from journey 's larger than life aor sound , and it 's virtually impossible to imagine steve perry agreeing to sing anything other than the ballad `` walkin ' away from the edge '' . then again , maybe that was the point.the rest of the songs on red 13 have a more rocking , almost progressive feel , which obviously suits neal schon just fine . he really gets a chance to exercise his considerable talent here . steve augeri ( aka the new guy ) , who performed so admirably onarrival , does n't really get a chance to shine on this ep . `` walking away from the edge '' was the only song where his performance was up front and dynamic . the rest of the tracks have him taking a back seat to the rest of the band , who use the opportunity to rock out a bit more than we 're used to hearing.i enjoyed this ep . it was a great showcase for the musicians in journey , and a statement of what they are capable of when the pressure to write radio-friendly hits is taken away.it may not be the typical journey release , but red 13 is enjoyable for what it is - a rocking , 24-minute , temporary departure from journey 's signature sound .

> jari is a fantastic instructor . she may not be as vibrant and outgoing as a christi taylor or a kari anderson , but she is straight to business , get results instructor . she could whip anyone into shape.this is another brilliant workout . i have all her other workouts and this is up there with them . you really fatigue your muscles here . free weights and high repetition to get the maximum burn . if you are going through a plateau or such , then this will push you beyond it . it 's really helpful to get your metabolism up because there is so much intensity for your muscles . the first time i did this , i could barely move the next day and in fact i still felt the effects of this for almost half a week . all you need is weights , maybe a dumbell if you want and you can use a step as your weight bench.i thoroughly enjoyed this workout ( yes , even through the fatigue and pain ) because i know it 's going to tone up almost any trouble spot and also because she is a good clear instructor who cues well . i would only suggest doing this three times a week maximum , but as always , consistensy is key and do this with cardio . i love it .

> i liked this book more than i thought i would , and my kids enjoyed it a lot as well . there is something to be said in this age of cheaply made sci fi movies that are a dime a dozen , when an author can still create an original monster that actually has a purpose and is frightening ( even to the adult reading the book . ) i enjoyed this story for a few reasons . it was interesting and well written enough to keep the kids looking forward to the next chapter and guessing out loud about what was going on with the mystery monster and what would happen to the main character.although the set up for the plot has been seen before in similar ways , the story itself evolved into something fresh and exciting . the story of how the father and son moved to the new location and why was well thought out and reflected in the story . i did n't have to wonder why things were happening.overall , this was a good story that i would recommend for kids 8 years old and older . it has my seal of approval as a mum and as a reviewer.this review is based off of a digital arc from the publisher and netgalley .

> margaret atwood was asked to venture into the area of greek mythology and craft a story from that time . she chose penelope , the long suffering wife of odysseus of trojan war fame . she picked penelope because mythology has painted her as the faithful wife who waited for twenty years for her husband to return . while odysseus was away and seemingly lost , numerous suitors descended on ithaca to try to win the hand of penelope . she managed to withstand the siege and stayed true to her lord and husband . but the thing about this story that captured ms. atwood 's attention was the return of odysseus and the bloody slaughter he committed . he and his son telemachus killed all the suitors , and for some reason , strung up penelope 's twelve young maids because they had been cavorting with the suitors . but it is margaret atwood 's genius that turns the story of penelope and her twelve hapless maids into something that is poignant , sad and funny all at the same time . in true atwood style , she makes the character of penelope real and vibrant . from myth to reality in one snappy little novella .

> band of horses are your typical sub pop style band in every positive sense of the phrase . they are a slightly folky , jangly , almost quirky band that offer up some great song writing and a short , snappy album for our delight . i love the two opening tracks and will skip back to the start to play them again before continuing with the rest of the album . this has an excellent booklet ( something that is sadly getting lost with the prevalence of downloads ) and this has some small postcards with various photos . the band have been compared to my morning jacket and they are certainly reminiscent of that band in places , but they also reminded me of the excellent death cab for cutie in places as well and if you like either band then you may well enjoy this album too . if you enjoy other bands of the sub pop stable then give this cd a try and if you also enjoy good song writing and short , punchy albums then this is worthy of your consideration.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> this book is somewhat like an excellent meal -- it starts out with a light appetizer in which the reader is introduced to amir the insecure son of baba , a wealthy man , and his best friend , hassan whose father is baba 's servant . the reader is given an inside look at afghan culture , including the delightful description of the kite-flying contest in which the last one with a kite in the air is the winner and the kites which are cut and fall to the ground are prized possessions for the `` kite runners '' . a tragic and violent incident brings on the heavy , main part of the meal , and the lives of the two boys are changed forever . unspeakable guilt and long-kept secrets work to undermine the happiness of the main characters . the dessert is the sweetness of repentance and redemption , which comes at great cost to some of the characters . the author uses the background of 30 years of political unrest in afghanistan as a setting for characters whose lives are likewise torn up and re-invented . this is a wonderful book which i highly recommend .

> this is one of my favourite adventure movies . journey to the center of the earth ( 1959 ) , based on the classic jules verne novel , was one of the most expensive and top-grossing fox productions of the decade . it stars james mason as professor lindenbrook , who accidentally discovers piece of evidence hidden inside a volcanic rock which could prove beyond all doubt that it 's possible for a man to travel deep inside the earth 's surface . with a team of explorers , including science student alec mckuen ( pat boone ) and widowed carla g & ouml ; teborg ( arlene dahl ) , the quest begins ... unlike the recent brendan fraser `` remake '' , this version of the story is charming , engaging and features some very impressive miniature and matte painting effects . primarily filmed on location in carlsbad national park , the cavern scenes are breathtaking . james mason and arlene dahl have a fantastic rapport.fox 's dvd features a print which has been newly restored from refurbished elements , and the stirring bernard herrmann score is showcased in a resonant 4-channel stereo mix . recommended !

> since we are military overseas , getting giftcards is never easy ... .let alone one that people would use over here . amazon is a major one here , they have some of the best shipping times and selections -- -so this is an obvious choice . but what makes this even better is the last-minute type of person ( me ) that you can print this off in less than 5 minutes and have it ready to go in a card ( although it looks pretty too when you print it ) in time for your party/event .
= easy to do at home !
< great for military overseas

> gratify 's gluten free pretzels do the amazing- they do n't taste gluten free . these pretzels have the traditional snap of regular pretzels . these are a little thicker than the twists but still they are crunchy and light as opposed to most gluten free snacks that are just hard . these have the traditional pretzel taste and the right mix of saltiness . gluten free or not these are just perfect pretzels . these are so great for dipping.these will disappear quickly so buy more than you need .
= great

> rick mofina does a good job at juggling three plots until they finally tie together and this is very much a fun read . the characters are mostly sympathetic , including samara . the idea of the rcmp character having as much free rein in investigating his case here in the u.s. stretched credibility a bit and i ca n't give this the highest rating , but it still ranks as a good thriller which is hard to put down once you start reading it .
= complex but fast moving

> this scalp massager works exactly like the more expensive ones you can find in shopping mall kiosks around the holidays or in specialty catalogs . the massager is simply a metal handle with plastic tipped wire fingers that you use to gently stimulate your scalp . the feeling is very odd at first and somewhat tingly , but quickly becomes pleasant.we liked ours so much that we bought a second one to give as a gift.highly recommended ! cfh

> a genuinely bizarre screwball comedy , starring cary grant as a man who has just remarried after his wife ( irene dunne ) has been declared legally dead , having gone missing for several years following a shipwreck in the pacific . naturally , she shows up the very same day , only to find her beloved hubby remarried and the kids all grown up , with no idea she 's their mom . but , for some reason , neither grant nor dunne can muster the courage to tell anyone right away what has gone wrong ( it 'd be an awful short film if they did ... ) and though that aspect of the movie is completely implausible , the film itself is predictably fun . several interesting aspects to the production ... first off , cary grant is at his absolute most drop-dead gorgeous ; just looking at him light up the screen makes up for any deficiencies in the script . dunne , who i usually find unappealling , also looks pretty good here , as does randolph scott ( who plays grant 's romantic rival ) ... i suspect the cinematographer is largely to thank ; the lighting on this film was very skillful , and brought out the best in all these stars . also check out the elaborate set design on the scenes that replicate the famous awahnee hotel , in yosemite valley ... you can tell it 's not quite the real deal ... but -- man ! -- is the set design impressive ! not the greatest film ever , but still a nice slice of fun , prewar entertainment .

> ` the long valley ' is yet another outstanding steinbeck book , this time a collection of short stories set around , and in , the salinas valley in california . from the betrayal of ` the chrysanthemums ' , via the simple evocation of ` breakfast ' and the look at husband and wife dynamics in ` the white quail ' , the harness ' and ` the murder ' this book leads you from beautiful story to another until it leaves you satisfied and breathless at the characterisation and imagery in ` red pony ' . this last story is in 4 part and covers nearly 80 pages and it moved me through a wide range of emotions . from contentment , sorrow , happiness , pity and more besides , this story has the ability to connect with you at a deep level and make you feel things as keenly as the characters . the only story to stand out from the others is ` saint katy the virgin ' which is about an almost demonic pig that gets converted to christianity . if nothing else this story is original ! this edition has a good introduction looking at the themes of the stories and makes for interesting reading in it 's own right . all in all , if you 're a fan of steinbeck you wo n't be disappointed . you 'll recognise the vivid imagery and beautiful writing and this is perfect to dip in and out of , or even read in one sitting . simply wonderful.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> we were looking at these mystery bags at a local store , which have two rare figures from the star wars angry birds set : han solo bird ( in carbonite ) and wedge antilles bird . i was going to try to get my son a sizable set since he loves building an imperial foot army and swarming them with rebel alliance militia ( he usually just throws them at the ground troops or uses his snowspeeder ) . we quickly discovered that you can easily feel through the bag to make sure you get the han solo in carbonite , but ca n't tell the difference between wedge and the others by feel . we got 4 bags and ended up with 1 wedge antilles and 2 han solos ( just mentioning those since they are supposedly rare , but is anything really collectible these days ? ) .these are tiny little star wars angry birds figures that you can use with the fighter pods series . they are tinier than the tip of your pinky finger . but , they are star wars angry birds and my son loves them . if only they did n't disappear so fast ... they are just so tiny that a set of 12 found hiding places good enough to evade my searches after he 'd only had them for 3 days.again , he loves them , so 4 stars . i 'll post a picture of them ... as soon as i can find one or two !

> abbott and costello broke through to a remarkable career when they got a chance to do their hilarious routine on the kate smith radio show in the late thirties . what was funny was the justifiable exasperation of costello with the conviction of abbott that his nonsense replies to the question , who 's on first , made perfect sense.similarly , in this book , carr takes a good plot for a cozy mystery , and a decently conceived set of characters , and sends the reader through a bizarre confusion of identities and behaviors which , rather than being funny or intricately patterned , becomes just a melange ( or mish-mash ) of relationships and behaviors which left this reader , at least , simply irritated , rather than intrigued . there is a difference between well-constructed puzzles and will-of-the-whist ambiguity.too bad . there are the makings of a good book here , if only the author had n't tried for a ross macdonald complexity without quite being able to carry it off.the two or three books i have read by the author are promising ( and i have several more in my kindle to read ) . you might enjoy the handling of situations in this book more than i did , or , you might want to read this as a background for later books in her series , which might be better organized .

> a little bit more violent than kids cartoons today , the original transformers series was a landmark in animation and probably the best cartoon series ever made . in 1986 , the transformers movie was released , and tf fans worldwide were shocked , surprised , stunned , and overjoyed with the results . the storyline is set in 2005 , roughly 13 years from the end of the second season of the series ( where it left off before the movie ) . megatron and his decepticons have taken over cybertron completely while optimus prime and his autobots plot to retake their home planet . ... transformers is explosive from beginning to end , ... sadly though , after the movie the series was never as great as it once was . an ensemble voice cast including eric idle of monty python as wrek-gar , judd nelson as hot rod , robert stack as ultra magnus , leonard nimoy as galvatron , and orson welles as unicron . the dvd itself is a bit scarce with extras , but the storyboards for unfinished scenes that never made it into the movie is interesting . highly recommended to those who remember their childhood .

> at first i thought coach carter was going to be another sports movie along the lines of the mighty ducks ( but in a basketball version ) but as the movie goes on , you find out the story it tells is actually pretty deep and has an important message behind it . the movie is not just about playing basketball and winning games , it 's about getting yourself a good education before having fun playing sports . it 's about realizing that basketball is a game you play for fun , while staying in school and learning is more important and more rewarding in the long run . the ending is the best part . i wo n't spoil it , though.also , there 's another message behind it . it 's to respect the people who are trying their best to help you . that 's what i got out of the movie .

> after the 9/11 attacks on the world trade center , a bi-partizan panel was established and directed to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the attacks . they had the time , the resources and the talent to exhaustively research what happened.as seems common with much of recent american history , all kinds of people have expressed all kinds of theories . perhaps the most visible of these is the movie fahrenheit 9/11 where every allegation that can be used as an attack upon president bush is presented as the final truth . most of the more outlandish claims have been addressed here giving the fundamental background information along with the origins of that information.this particular publication is abridged to be read in eight hours and is supplied on seven compact disks .

> you do not need to read the second and third volumes of stieg larsson 's bestselling international trilogy . the girl with the dragon tattoo is a complete story with a satisfying ending.what genre does this novel belong to ? before reading it , i was unsure . i supposed it was a high-tech action-suspense-thriller , like the bourne trilogy . there is some tech : mobile phones and a good amount of laptop computer activity , though that 's not high tech . there 's some sex and some action , but not a lot of either . as i read it , i learned that this novel most appropriately belongs to the genre of mystery . its prose reminded me of rex stout or agatha christie , with background details about the setting and background details about members of a large family , from which the reader tries to identify the killer.what made this book a bestseller ? the plot is not the answer . it is hackneyed . an investigator is hired to learn about the events of a murder , question family members , and solve the mystery . the setting is sweden , a bit refreshing for me , but i 'm sure the setting alone did not make this a bestseller . nor did the unremarkable tech or action . no , what made it a bestseller is the charm of the heroine . as i absorbed myself in the girl with the dragon tattoo , my best moments came as i learned about her.i wo n't go so far as to say that i adored her , but i guess my feelings were along that direction . at least for me -- though other reviewers do n't think so -- she was bright , shiny , new , and original . but i do n't want to describe why she was so . a description would spoil your own moments of discovery , which await your own reading .

> gabe singleton is living the good life of the rural doctor , enjoying the wide-open spaces of wyoming and the joys of riding a horse . unfortunately , he has a past and is stunned when his roommate at the naval academy arrives unexpectedly via helicopter and almost pleads for his help . the roommate is andrew stoddard and he is now the president of the united states . stoddard has been a good president and gabe backs his policies . however , stoddard is in the midst of a very difficult re-election fight and his personal physician has mysteriously disappeared . after bringing back old times , both good and bad , stoddard manages to convince gabe to fly back to washington and take on the difficult task of serving the president.decades earlier , gabe had gotten mindlessly drunk and while driving had caused an accident that led to the deaths of others . although he has no memory of the incident , he has spent his life trying to atone for the mistake . it still haunts him , and he fears that it will resurface once he is in the destructive grinder that is washington politics.however , shortly after he is installed in the white house , an incident occurs that leads him to believe that stoddard is going insane . that is not the case ; the plot is much deeper and more diabolical than a simple case of insanity . the plot takes many twists and turns and the primary driver of the conspiracy against the president is a person that you would not place near the top of your suspect list.the action is energetic and entertaining , although at the end it becomes a bit bizarre . in order to protect the president , gabe feels it necessary to kidnap him and the existence of their hideout stretches your credulity .

> if you 're a ps3 owner , chances are that you 've already heard various things about demon 's souls . no matter what you may have heard though , the one thing that you need to believe first and foremost before you even consider popping this game in is the fact that it is unbelievably difficult , incredibly challenging , and just plain unforgiving . no mid-level save points , getting sent back to the beginning of a level after you die , re-spawning firerce enemies ; yes , demon 's souls is probably one of the hardest games you 'll ever play , regardless of the genre . that being said however , demon 's souls is also one of the absolute best action/rpg 's you 'll ever play as well . technically speaking , demon 's souls is simply a gorgeous sight to behold . the level designs are foreboding , dark , and varied from one another , while the game 's creature designs are brilliant as well . the game 's combat mechanics are intricate and deep , with boss battles being nothing short of epic as well . along with some great online features , demon 's souls has all the makings of being a great game , and indeed it is , but it definitely is n't something for everybody . as said before , the game 's difficulty will frustrate you to almost no end , yet you 'll keep coming back regardless . if anything , demon 's souls is reminiscent of the arcade/action games of yesteryear in these terms , and the game is all the better for it . all in all , if you 're looking for something spectacularly challenging and unbelievably difficult , demon 's souls is just what the doctor ordered . do n't say that you were n't warned though .

> to say that mumford and sons debut ` sigh no more ' is truly infectious and will get your feet tapping is a gross understatement . from the album opener until the dying notes of ` after the storm ' i often have a sloppy grin plastered across my face and find myself dancing and slapping my leg with gusto : and even though there are some more slower paced ballads mixed in here , this is still an upbeat and joyous album . the banjo playing never fails to delight me and it adds that frenetic , fast tempo sound that only this instrument can offer . there are so many good tracks on this album it is difficult to single any one out , although ` little lion man ' is one of the most well known and has one of those choruses you ca n't help but shout along with full blast . the more gentle ` after the storm ' is a beautiful way to end the album as well and manages to bring you down from your album buzz without any feeling of let down whatsoever . there is much talk of this band being ` nu-folk ' and how there has been a traditional folk backlash etc , but to be honest who cares about labels and pigeon holes , taken on face value and enjoying the music for what it is ( which is all anyone should do anyway ! ) , this is a great album of a band who are obviously enjoying themselves and offering us some excellent songs , performed with verve and passion . who could really ask for anything more ? one of the best albums i have bought recently and well worth a try.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> jake gyllenhaal , star of the godforsaken film bubble boy , gives the performance of his young career here as title character donnie darko . in 1988 , young donnie is a borderline schizo who sees a grotesque man size reptilian/rabbit which he follows and obeys . one night when donnie goes off sleepwalking , the rabbit ( who is called frank ) tells donnie that the world will end in 28 days . the next morning as donnie stumbles home , we see his home has been decimated by a jet plane engine . it is here where donnie begins to wonder if all this really is all in his head , or if he is n't crazy and is meant for something more . as the film rolls along he meets and falls in love with the new girl ( jena malone ) , and becomes obsessed with the theories of time travel . patrick swayze is here as a self help guru who may or may not be who he says he is , and nearly steals the show with his great performance . mary mcdonnel is great as well as donnie 's mother , and noah wyle and drew barrymore ( she also was an executive producer of the film ) play husband and wife teachers . writer/director richard kelly has crafted an unbelieveably moving film that scares , shocks , and plays with the mind of the viewer while having a sense of dark humor to it all . all in all , those craving a different kind of thriller should definitely give this a look . this is destined to become a cult classic , and the fact donnie goes to see evil dead in a theater makes this film even more of a gem .

> according to the amazon page - `` it ( bissell 2x professional ) outcleans all other formulas . '' is n't that what they all say ? as luck would have it , my usually well behaved bolgnese peed on on the carpet the day before the bissell arrived in the mail . she punctuated that sin by leaving her autograph in another room the next day too.by the time i got to the first stain in my computer room , the mark was bright yellow and dry . i ran the spot bot on it twice with two different products ( capture and hoover ) , yet a distinct spot still remained . curses ! i tried again the next day using the spot bot with bissell 2x professional in the tank . amazingly the spot completely disappeared . on the second pee spot i used a hoover upright carpet cleaner and the bissell cleaner . again the carpet looked terrific after cleaning with no trace of any stains . gabby has n't peed in the house again since those accidents , so i can say with reservation she has n't returned to the scene of her crimes.impressions : this bissell cleaner works very well , and i like that it 's already concentrated so that i do n't have to concentrate while cleaning.the product does have a strong scent coming out of the container , but the scent does dissipate soon after cleaning.it 's just a personal quirk of mine , but i like to clean carpet twice , once with cleaning product and once with plain , hot water . i 'm always amazed by how dirty the water still is on the second cleaning .

> i was not aware , that the book lone survivor was available . but when i read all the raves about the movies . i knew i must find it and read it . i will not go into a lot of the substance of the story , as it is already well documented in the reviews for the purchase for this book.i liked this book , because of the flow of the story , which was delivered , throughout the book . i was very interested in the description of all the built up to the problems happening in afghanistan , and learnt a lot about background of this troubled country , that i was not fully aware of.i have heard a lot about navy seals , but had not read any thing so detailed about the training these fellows go through , i am surprised , that so many survive to qualify.my heart went out to marcus 's parents when it was reported he was missing in action , and marvelled at the support they got . which was great as there are so many knockers out in the general public , who do n't support our troops doing a difficulty job , under extreme conditions , and against a terrible enemy.i really felt i was with marcus , going through this terrible ordeal , and i must admit i had a couple of tears . to sum up .. it 's the best book i have read from the afghanistan conflict .

> karajan always provided a musical featherbed for his singers when he conducted opera , and here he takes la boheme carefully , with measured tempos to wring every last tear . if you love the opera , this is a wonderful approach ( at the very opposite of beecham 's famed mono account with bjorling and de los angeles , which is brisk and unsentimental . well , as unsentimental as one can be with boheme ) . on the twentieth hearing i am as moved by this performance as the first time i heard it . pavarotti in prime voice and freni as a mimi to tear your heart out make an unmatched pair -- how amazing that they both come from the small north italian town of modena.the orchestra and decca 's sonics are vast for such an intimate opera , but that only adds to the emotional excess -- a compliment in this case . harwood is n't the musetta of my dreams , but she was a karajan favorite and does well here , far beter than her embarrassing merry widow under him . the la scala veteran rolando panerai could n't be bettered as marcello , and he can stand up to pavarotti 's overwhelming presence.in sum , i would n't change a thing , but canny buyers might anticipate that decca will release a remastered version someday in their originals line . the sound is fine already , but sonic updating never hurts . highly recommended .

> thank you for smoking ! reality or fiction ? whether you realize it or not , we are constantly bombarded with messages about what is cool , or hip , or deadly , or immoral.this is a fictionalized account of one such battle : smoking tobacco . when the evidence is so clear that smoking harms both the smoker and others inhaling the smoke , why is smoking tobacco still legal ? it is because there is a cadre of professionals whose job it is to make sure we hear and absorb certain messages , like the government wants smokers to die so that agencies can get larger budgets , while tobacco companies want smokers to live because smokers are their best customers ( example taken from the movie ) ! this film is very entertaining , with a number of great , great actors . rated pg-13 , and highly recommended . i give this film 4 stars instead of 5 because the sex scenes ( admittedly limited ) and language will keep younger children from seeing this film ... and i 'd like to see more people , not less , view this film .

> of the many words i might use to describe a feehan book , boring would not be one of them until i read dark melody . perhaps i 've read too many of her novels , or perhaps i 've just grown bored of the formula : domineering guy , wimpy girl , a psychic bond 'lifemates ' etc . but dark melody bored me to tears.the heroine corrine ( 6 months pregnant ) , irritated me . she was way too perfect and saintly . the hero dayan seemed to be a carbon copy of all the other carpathian guys : ie , over-the-top , possessive , and while protesting that 'he does n't like to manipulate and control others using his mental powers ' somehow managing to do so anyway . the endless exposition about carpathian men and carpathian culture was also quite tedious . and just once , just once , i 'd like to see a psychic female refuse to 'mate ' with one of these controlling jerks ( let alone agree to become an instant baby-factory ) .1 star . worse than the last if such a thing were possible .

> because it requires only two singers and a conductor in sympathy with bartok 's quasi-gothic melodrama , you 'd think bluebeard 's castle would be easy to record . yet such estimable conductors as boulez and dorati have come up with duds ; we are still waiting for a modern set to compete with the remarkably vivid kertesz recording from the mid-sixties . that 's an unmissable performance , one that put bluebeard on the map , but this sony set is more than respectable . it has excellent sound , fine orchestral playing , and adam fischer 's committed , if not inspired , conducting . of the two principals , ramey excels because of his gorgeous , steady bass , but marton , a native hungarian , turns in a generalized big-voice reading a la jessye norman , and her tone wobbles under pressure . even so , i got a lot of enjoyment from this set .

( note : mike , you could have done a lot with the idea of fraternity house zombies . just sayin ' . ) enter ams , a government agency not much liked by anyone , and a bunch of soldiers . yes , you 're thinking what i 'm thinking , are n't you ? i kept waiting for one of the soldiers to ask if they were going on another bug hunt . the twist here is that ams believes it can develop a vaccine if they can get blood from the first zombie , so the team has to find that first zombie.the requisite yumness is provided by horror veteran emmanuelle vaugier and my name is earl beauty nadine velasquez , and the requisite cameo is provided by sid haig , and other than that , honestly , there 's nothing much more to say . it 's typical , standard fare that does n't stand out in any way . if you 're looking for a way to kill an hour and a half , this will do the trick better than some and worse than many . *

> i was hugely imressed by the first three connelly books i read ... two of them featuring harry bosch and the other with terry mccaleb . void moon seemed a letdown , and i hoped that this one with both major characters would be back to what i expect from connelly . no such luck.primarily the & quot ; mystery & quot ; is very disappointing . you should have it all figured by the time you 're a third through . i did miss one element , but the rest was painfully obvious . i was so disappointed that i came close to giving this two stars . however , the characterization was strong all the way through and the climactic scenes made much of the preceding more worthwhile . we 're taken deeper within the psyches of each , and the last few chapters sharply define the inner selves of the two main characters.references to earlier novels and brief glimpses of characters we met in previous novels do help keep the interest . i was quite pleased that one character from void moon made an appearance . i think connelly likes his characters and keeps us informed as to how they 're doing . this was fast reading , and not a complete waste of time . in fact , i suspect that foundations were built in this story which will influence future books.i believe that connelly 's fans will want to read this , they should just be warned that they may be disappointed . those who are n't yet acquainted with connelly probably would do much better to start back earlier in the harry bosch books , and also with blood work . by the way , i notice clever plugs for the upcoming movie , blood work , in both angel 's flight and in this one .

> the movie starts out great . it is smart , sharp , and witty . i would highly recommend doing a quick reading on whitman 's `` leaves of grass '' on wiki if you are unfamiliar with whitman 's work , what he was trying to accomplish , the criticism of it , as well as the fact he spent his whole life re-writing and expanding it . the movie had the feel of a five star indie in the beginning . edward norton , who i have yet to respect as an actor , plays two roles : bill kincaid and his twin brother brad . bill and brad are both super intelligent . brad , the smarter of the two when young , grows pot and enjoys life on the edge . bill teaches classical philosophy at brown university . brad gets his girlfriend pregnant and in order to get bill to come back to oklahoma for the wedding , has his friend contact bill and tell him that he is dead.brad has other plans for bill and plans to use him as an alibi . at this point the movie goes from great to wtf ? the flick digresses into what appears to be a writer 's inability to figure out how to end a story . brad , as the smarter brother should of had a better scheme , one where everyone gets what they want , rather than do things by the seat of his pants . i was very disappointed in the writers for leading us down a path that would have made a great classic movie and then not being able to close the deal .

> when i go to see a movie , i either go to be entertained , or to learn something . i do n't want to sit and analise a movie through and through , so i 'm not going to write about the direction or the score or stuff like that.i believe this to be very close to the truth ( there were a few differences from what i can remember about what i learnt of this topic in history ) . several teams were sent within europe for revenge killings , but anyway ... eric bana was excellent in this . his accent was down perfectly , and you could see he was a conflicted guy . he was glad to get revenge , but yet he did things he thought were beyond him as a human being and he worried for his family . the determination in his eyes was obvious but there was sadness too . when he heard his baby on the phone for the first time and he broke down , that was heart-wrenching.overall , this is a fantastic movie that does n't go into major depth about the actual munich games themselves , but the aftermath of israel making those responsable pay . from the real footage of coverage on news tv ( with peter jennings voice ) to the final scene , i really enjoyed this great movie and i barely noticed that it was in fact 2 hours and 40 something minutes . i highly recommend this .

> brad bird 's delightful `` ratatouille '' has proven yet again what we already know . that is , you do n't need a big name or catchy music to make a great animation . all you need is believable characters you can relate to and an interesting story driven by them even though one of the characters is actually a most incredible creation -- a french gourmet rat named remy , who goes to paris and establishes friendship with a shy boy working in the kitchen of a ( formerly ) five-star restaurant.brad bird , who scored a one-two punch by giving us two fantastic animations , anmely `` the iron giant '' and `` the incredibles , '' has created one of the most charming characters in the movie history in remy , a rat who loves cooking more than anything . the lovable rat 's colorful facial and bodily expressions of emotions are always amusing to see , with dynamic movements that only gifted animators can create . ( look close at the end of the film and its `` no motion capture '' credit . ) not many words are necessary to describe the pure joy of watching this amazing animation . enjoy the unpredictable story of remy 's adventures plus colorful world of his kitchen . and the film concludes with a strong statement about critic 's role , which is quietly done but most biting .

> ` blue harvest ' is the excellent ` family guy ' parody of star wars : a new hope and it ticks every box you can imagine . it 's extremely funny , well written , short yet sweet and it has stewie as dath vadar , what more could you want ? condensing the whole star wars film into about 45-50 minutes , this film still manages to pack in hilarious gags and parodies the original , whilst still being deferential to it 's influence on ` family guy ' itself . seeing stewie as vadar , picking holes in the death stars design flaws and peter as han solo , who rings his mum to let her know he 's ok after a space battle , are just a few minor touches ( out of many ) that make this so delightful to watch . it may be short , but this is perfectly formed and if you 're fan of ` family guy ' then this will be right up your street and if you 've never seen it before then this is n't that bad a place to start either ! great viewing.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> after reading floating worlds , i had a hard time believing that i had never heard of the book before . it is an intelligent and complex novel of the future which combines elements of technology , politics , and space to create a compelling story . it should rightly have a place next to the more famous works from the period , and i am pleased to see that it has been reprinted.paula mendoza is a slightly-more-than-typical inhabitant of the anarchist planet earth . she becomes even more distinctive when she becomes earth 's representative to the styths and along the way bears a son to the styth prima . she becomes the pin that links the two cultures together as much as two such separate cultures can be linked.holland 's writing is vividly detailed , and the world that she creates for the future is so well imagined that it is disappointing when the book ends . i found the plotting a little but weak in places , but any deficiencies are made up for by the strong characters . i particularly liked the realistic way that she sets up the variations on human stock represented by the styth.definitely worth reading .

> i was somewhat leery of an electronic reader , but due to the urging of my more electronic savvy friends , i bought the basic kindle . man this thing is great ! i take it when i go the doctor 's office , while in a restaurant by myself or anywhere you may be waiting a period of time . i use glasses but the kindle is easier to read ( and lighter ) than most books . my only complaint is the cost of kindle books . yes friends , convenience co $ t $ . i still use the library for books , but use the kindle if there is a long wait at the library . the nice thing about this kindle is that it is lightweight , and easy to turn pages and extremely readable . i like mine , you should like yours , too . unless you have an aversion to advertising , the basic kindle is all you need .

> i owned a prototype sony ereader with electronic ink . it still had controls in japanese with limited functionality . then came the english version sony ereader which became stable and usable but it gave access to obscure books that never interested me . now , amazon has taken a great `` quantum '' leap in reading techniques . their wireless option , range of fonts , simplified downloading , and multi-function improvements make this device state-of-the-art with an implied certainty that amazon will continue to support it and grow the library of available books and documents . regrettably , many reviewers complain about the price . i wonder what they think is fair ? are you aware of the current prices of sophisticated technology ? what about an xbox , nintendo ds ? these are expensive toys while the kindle has the potential for expanding our personal library and minds .

> this is the story of a black soldier 's tour of duty in vietnam . writing in the first person , author walter dean myers adopts a minimalist approach that suits his narrator , a teenager from harlem with a gift for writing . this style made it a little difficult to get into the story , and for a while i wondered whether i would be able to immerse myself in this novel in a satisfying manner . my fears were unwarranted . although myers 's prose is quite efficient , he is adept at selecting details that accumulate over the course of the novel to present a full , moving picture of what it was like to participate in that harrowing conflict . myers effectively portrays both the horrors of battle and the comfort of camaraderie , making for a fully rounded reading experience .

> works perfectly and it has a sturdy construction . i hook one end to a laptop and the other to the tv . i try to give the pc laptop side a bit of support by putting the laptop on a table that has some space on it so the cable can lay across it , thereby avoiding over stressing the input on the laptop due to the weight of the cable . very simple and a good length as it allows you to sit across the room from the tv , where you typically watch from , and control the videos from there . for pc laptops it just mirrors to the tv screen what you are displaying on the laptop ( the hdmi interface that is and so this cable as well ) .

> when zack does n't show up at work for several days in a row , turing is concerned . she does what she can to find him , but her resources are a little limited . while she can find any bit of information , she ca n't actually investigate in person because she 's an artificial intelligence personality , or aip for short . asking the aid of human friends maude and tim , turing begins to get a picture that causes her to worry more . zack seems to have stumbled on something huge . but was he killed or is he hiding out ? and can turing protect her friends , human and aip , when the danger continues to build ? i 've enjoyed ms. andrews ' other series , but was a bit skeptical when it came to this book . an aip as the main character ? this just sounded too far fetched for me . yet she pulled it off with no trouble what-so-ever . all three of the main characters come off as fully developed . most interesting was turing , who reminded me of similar characters in the various star trek series . she has true strengths and weaknesses and grows the most as a character because of the story . the plot is a little slow getting off the ground , but the time is used to establish turing and her environment . once the story takes off , it moves at lightning speed . i was often turning pages to find out what would happen next . the point of view switches from turing to maude and tim , making the best dramatic use of the story . the ending seemed a bit rushed , but only a little.i 'm looking forward to seeing what ms. andrews has up her sleeves next for turing and her friends . this is a fascinating world i look forward to visiting many more times to come .

> john woo has created the biggest budget epic yet to be produced in china . red cliff ( chi bi ) is a monumentally grand film , distilling portions of the novel of chinese history , 'romance of the three kindgoms ' by guanzhong luo , to recreate the famous battle in 180 ad between the north of china lead by evil cao cao ( prime minister in the han dynasty ) and the south of china represented by the gentle and wise liu bei . the historic battle took place on land and especially on water as the huge forces from the north traveled the yangtze river to the pass called the red cliffs ( chi bi ) where the southern forces gathered and came into ultimate confrontation.the story is told both by voice over ( in english ) and by the actors - a cast that includes such highly regarded actors as tony leong , takeshi kneshiro , fengyi zhang , chen cang , wei zhao among others . the interpersonal relationships are well constructed but the real thrill of this film is the choreography of the battle scenes . the cinematography by li zhang and yue l & uuml ; is splendid : the views of china 's landscape are breathtakingly beautiful . the costumes by tim yip are complex and are apparently authentic in rendering the period . the only disappointment is the musical score by tar iwashiro which sounds too western to fully enhance the visual epic before the viewers eyes . the pacing is such that the greater than 2 1/2 hours of the film seem to fly by ( apparently this is a condensation of parts i and ii released in china ) . john woo knows how to manage spectacle but he also understands the importance of emphasizing the human interactions that prepare the viewer for the explosive climaxes . grady harp , january 10

> nocturnes [ by the author of the book of lost things ] is the first collection of short stories by irish author john connolly . the book consists of 15 stories : the cancer cowboy rides , mr pettinger 's daemon , the erlking , the new daughter , the ritual of the bones , the furnace room , the underbury witches , the inkpot monkey , the shifting of the sands , some children wander by mistake , deep dark green , miss froom vampire , nocturne , the wakeford abyss , & the reflecting eye : a charlie parker novella.if you love the english gothic horror master m.r . james , you 'll definitely appreciate the stories here ... they are basically supernatural stories , but some have been also given the crime thriller treatment to good effect . some of my favorites in this collection are `` the uderbury wiches '' , in which two lndon detectives go to a small rural town to investigate a mysterious death , and find links with witch burnings dating back to the 17th century . the last story in the collection , the reflecting eye has charlie parker , pi as its protagonist ... he finds himself being hired to investigate an abandoned house that once was the residence of a child murderer . the present owner of the house finds a picture of a young girl in the mailbox , and wants parker to ascertain the identity of the girl , worried that the child is either a victim of the murderer in the past , or a new victim targeted by a would-be copycat killer . suffice to say , all these stories share an abundance of chills , and are written with great atmosphere , and well-plotted . a must-read for fans of supernatural horror or thrillers .

> aesop 's fables is a collection of fables credited to aesop , a storyteller believed to have lived in ancient greece between 620 and 560 bc . several hundred fables have been credited to him , with each fable consisting of a brief story , followed by a moral to the story . most of the characters in aesop 's fables were animals that take on some human qualities such as speech but retain their basic animal characteristics like size and speed.this little volume includes four of the fables with a fox as the main character . in `` the fox and the crow , '' we learn that flattery may indeed get you everywhere , or at least a bite to eat . `` the fox and the goat '' is probably the origin of the caution `` look before you leap . '' `` the fox and the grapes '' shows that we often despise what we can not have , leading to the expression `` sour grapes . '' the last story , `` the fox and the cat , '' has been interpreted several ways , but i think the moral of the story can be summed up as `` a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . `` this is a great introduction to aesop 's fables for kids . the stories and the lessons learned are simple enough for even younger kids to understand , and there 's some real wisdom behind the stories .

> grizzlies are dangerous ! now that we got that out . what else is to be said ? treadwell was lucky he was n't eaten sooner . the tragedy of what happened was hard for me to take because you have to admire their goals . the movie has insight but to my mind it does n't tell people to stay away from them well enough . i remember years ago i heard about three girls camping out , and that one was dragged out of their camp while in her sleeping bag . the others found her half eaten the next day . at the time i was young and ready to go hunt grizzlies . i now realize they are just stupid animals looking for a meal . i say stupid because if they had a clue of what humans are capable of doing to them , they would avoid them at all cost . i have a great deal of respect for them otherwise . see the movie at least once and judge for yourself whether his message is inciteful or insightful . i personally like herzog 's documentary `` the white diamond '' on the rain forest better . if you are looking for a documentary about grizzlies this is a decent one because of herzog 's editing , if you are looking for great excitement try a kodiak bear in `` the edge '' .

> gold star award winner ! many of us are familiar with homer 's timeless classic . odysseus , hero of the trojan war , is desperately trying to return home . the gods have not looked upon him favorably , and he has incurred the wrath of poseidon . his adventures are housed in this new graphic novel edition.he relates the tales of the cyclops , the sirens , and the deadly scylla , who decimate his ship and crew . his journey is long , tireless , and wrought with sadness . because of his persistence and loyalty to the gods , he is rewarded in the end.gareth hinds has retold and illustrated many classic tales , including beowulf , king lear , and the merchant of venice . his artwork is nothing short of amazing . he has provided stunning watercolors to enhance the retelling of this epic poem . he has also made the poem much more accessible to teen readers.hinds has taken great pains to stay true to the original tale , including quotes that come directly from the text . this edition would be an excellent way of supplementing a unit about the odyssey . teen readers who are curious about greek mythology and literature should definitely give this graphic novel a chance . i am anxiously awaiting hinds ' next literary offering ! reviewed by : ladyjay

> this little book ( only 126 pages ) does many different things , all very well , and most better than books many times its size . hedren has chosen 54 specific historical sites relating to the great sioux war and arranged them chronologically , with site 1 being the grattan battlefield in wyoming ( commemorating an 1854 incident which helped set the stage for later events ) and site 54 being sitting bull 's grave in south dakota ( he died in 1890 ) . in addition to these 54 `` official '' sites , hedren identifies and directs readers to many other related locations nearby.each site gets a number ( which is also pin-pointed on a map ) , a brief description of the its significance , and directions to it ( also whether it 's on private property or not ) ; then follows a longer historical account of the site 's role in the war and a number of photographs indicating what a visitor to the site would see . it 's a magnificent tool for anyone touring the area ( most sites are in wyoming , montana , south dakota , and nebraska ) , but it 's just as valuable ( and exciting ) for anyone interested in the sioux war who ca n't leave his livingroom . a great book . highly recommended .

> unlike other reviewers who tried some of the remedies suggested in this work and found it relieved their pain , i can not review the book on the basis of having tested any of its recommendations . instead i review it on the basis of certain subjects i take interest in in regard to pain relief . on the whole i liked the open approach of the work making use of conventional allopathic medicine and also various alternative medicines . the great stress on proper diet and proper medication also seems reasonable and right.what bothered me somewhat however was the brevity and lack of depth in regard to treatment of the subject . for instance as one with an inherited tendency to rheumatoid arthritis i had hoped to learn more about various kinds of this condition , and how they related to other ailments and aches.i would have liked to understand more about inflammation and understand how to treat a minor chronic ache i have in one thumb . i just did not get exactly what i was looking for . still i recognize i touched upon only a few of the many pain- related subjects involved in this book . and my sense is that it contains much information which can be useful to pain sufferers .

> `` the dracula chronicles : bound by blood - volume 2 '' by shane o'neill is another great work in this excellent and fresh dracula series.this second book again combines history with the vampire myths in a great interweaving of the biblical lucifer , vlad iii dracula , voivode of wallachia , his family and his friends.this time we begin in saxony with luther and his work 'against ' the catholic church but the journey through the ages continues as bad and evil fight each other . particularly welcome is the introduction of a nemesis for vlad iii dracula , brought into play by lucifer himself.as with volume i , the historical elements in the book are really well done and make this an enjoyable and intelligent read that easily surpasses most vampire and dracula stories . there is a competence and power in this writing that makes the story feel very real , despite the paranormal aspects.the characters are well developed and the dialogue runs very smoothly . the book is powerful , competent and very engaging.highly recommended for all fans of the genre but particularly for those who also appreciate literary quality .

> even in the seventies , at the outset of his conducting career with big international orchestras , a time when barenboim had no credentials to compete with veteran brucknerians , he got his way . it 's amazing how much music barenboim has committed to disc , in fact , without any obvious show of talent on the podium.you would think form his extensive discography that he is another bernstein , capable of infusing any work with his own personal stamp . that is far from the case . barenboim , one must admit , was a wunderkind , but more along the lines of maazel -- he is a facile , willful conductor whose ideas never go very deep . that he has self-styled himself in the great tradition of furtwangler is ludicrous.this bruckner is n't terrible , and the cso makes a good , if at times brash showing . if you must have barenobim in these works -- why ? -- his later traversal on erato with the berlin phil . is much more accomplished and in wonderful sound .

> this is the fifth volume in the `` essential elvis '' series . it features alternate takes of songs recorded at the famous stax recording studio in 1973. the first recording sessions were held in july . things did n't go as well as planned for various reasons ; including a lack of good songs , problems with the recording equipment and a general lack of enthusiasm from elvis . despite the dissapointing results , another recording session was held at stax in december . the results were a lot better this time around , with several good songs and a more committed elvis . thankfully , 12 of the 18 songs on this cd are from december . that 's not to say that july was a complete failure ; `` i 've got a thing about you baby '' is a great song , but `` three corn patches '' is very mediocre . on the other hand , almost all the songs from december are good . `` promised land '' was elvis ' last great `` rocker '' . `` good time charlie 's got the blues '' is a great country song . and `` i got a feeling in my body '' and `` if that is n't love '' are terrific gospel numbers . these alternate takes are n't as polished as the master takes , but they are still fun to listen to . you even get to hear elvis fooling around before some of the songs , including singing bits of other songs like `` softly , as i leave you '' and `` surrender '' . this is an enjoyable cd for elvis fans .
= wait a minute , fellas ! do n't go without me !

> i was n't sure what to expect , but i was pleasantly surprised . it made me think of a religious version of one of the many slightly comedic mob movies like `` snatch '' . two young irish catholic brothers decide that evil is rampant . when the catholic priest tells his church about a elderly woman that was killed with people standing around doing nothing , the men decide things have gone to far . they still do n't do anything until some russian mobsters try to kick them out of a pub that belongs to a friend . even then they just beat up the mobsters , but when the mobster break into their apartment and try to kill them they start to change . the change at first is minor but as they are supported by the city of boston they become more bold in removing evil from the streets . brilliant directing , good production values , and plenty of action make this well worth checking out . willem defoe as the gay fbi agent and sean patrick flanery and norman reedus as the brothers are outstanding , and the rest the cast are good . the story never takes itself to seriously and the introduction of a hitman that even the mob fears adds just another layer of icing . well worth renting and i bought a copy myself . the dvd is great quality and has good replayability . if you enjoyed this catch `` layer cake '' ca luster

> i first was introduced to mexican soft drinks with mexican coca cola . it was rare at the time , but now it 's distribution is much more widespread . there 's a subtle difference between mexican coke and american coke , but once you get onto it you 'll be drinking mexican coke . you might say it 's gourmet coca cola . some people say the difference is due to mexican products being made with real sugar and american soft drinks made with high-fructose corn syrup . that might be it . in any case , there 's a difference . well , my nearby fresh and easy neighborhood market is closing out four lines of mexican soft drinks and one of them is sidral mundet apple soda and the price is only $ 0.50 per 1.5 liter bottle while the supply lasts.well , this apple soda and the other mexican soft drinks are really good and i 'm buying up as much as my small panty can hold . the apple soda had a taste unlike american apple drinks , but is very good . it 's sweetened with cane sugar , but is not an overly sweet beverage . that , i like . american drinks are just too sweet . this stuff makes a real ice drink with my evening meals and i would guess that the calorie content was not overly high . the nutrition label says 130 per serving . in any case , it 's an excellent beverage.gary peterson
= apple soda . good flavor . not overly sweet . real sugar .

> at the time of its release , on the corner drew the ire of many reviewers because - it was written - it could not be considered a `` jazz '' album . the album is brilliant and the only problem i had with the original release on lp was the length ; i wanted more music ! the dilemma by placing too much faith in the musings of music critics throughout the electric period of miles was the seemigly placement of each album in a vaccum , as if the artist was n't building on a concept . and miles - as always was the case - was creating a sound for concerts and in the studio.by bringing funk to the forefront of the sound , miles was essentially placing the final paint strokes on a canvas - merging his studio and live ideas in a tight package - that is still misunderstood in 2006.miles bolstered the sound with a larger studio group , including such regulars like chick corea , herbie hancock , john mclaughlin , jack dejohnette , dave liebman and michael henderson.a great live companion piece to on the corner is dark magus , which chronicles one of the last concerts before miles went into a nearly seven year retirement .

> like most of the reviews say , this game is absolutely hilarious . i was shocked by how much my friends and i actually laughed and enjoyed ourselves with the funny combinations we came up with . i will definitely be buying an expansion pack over the summer . the box seems durable , the instructions are not written on tissue paper , and the cards themselves are laminated and as long as you do n't use them to pick crap out of your teeth they 're going to last.for those of you who have a stick up your ass about how it 's inappropriate , do some research before you buy something . it says 17+ on the box , and it 's pretty clear from the website that this is not a game for children , and certainly not because it talks about horribly boring political topics or gardening tips . this is not to say that every card is horrifically disgusting , for those of you wondering ! there are plenty of normal cards that could be played in perfectly reasonable ways.overall , a great little game for when friends come over and throw back a few brewskis.- a colorado college student

> i love my cover . it fits my kindle perfectly and the magnet works perfect . the fact that closing the cover puts it into sleep mode definitely helps to save my battery life.i only have two issues . one is that while it is sturdy it is not a solid box case . so i 'm always afraid that the screen could still be damaged . but considering the do n't make otterboxes for kindle paperwhite and this is so far the best i could find , i am ok with it . the other issue is that now that it is in the cover i do n't think i could get it out if i wanted to . when i say it fits perfectly i mean perfectly . it 's not going to fall out accidentally or anything , but there does n't seem to be an easy way to get it out . again i 'm ok with this since in do n't plan on taking it out and this is it 's permanent case .

> & # 34 ; the small hand & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; dolly & # 34 ; by susan hill are two ghostly novels in one book . these novels are both chilling with an old fashioned creepiness to them . it seems a good ghost story has all but vanished from the horror genre and been replaced with slasher and scenes of bloody gore . susan hill does n't need blood spattered , gory props to make her stories cause the hair on your arms to stand straight up or think twice about turning off the light before you go to sleep at night . all she needs are words to weave into a tale that will make you wish you were n't so nervous about what you 'll find on the next page but , at the same time , anxious about not knowing.this author seems to have unearthed a talent for writing a good ghost story . the type we see so rarely these days .

> this little squares combine the subtle flavor or oats with a hint of brown sugar . the flavor is subtle and not too sweet . made with whole grains , the cereal provides five grams of fiber . the little squares hold up well to soy ilk but are also good as a snack right out of the box . i also used them as an ingredient in trail mix where they provided a welcome crunch . i also used them as training treats for my young german shepherd . she loves them and they seem to be healthier than the usual.this is a nice cereal . what you lack in gimmicks . excess sugar and fake flavor , you gain in in wholesome goodness .

> this doll recaptures the charm from the animated andalasian segments of disney 's hit movie `` enchanted '' . the character of giselle comes dressed in her long pink gown with flouncy white off-the-shoulder collar . a wreath of flowers sits atop her long strawberry blonde hair.unlike the 'fairytale wedding ' giselle doll ( which has a realistic face sculpted in the likeness of actress amy adams ) , this doll 's head is molded to resemble the animated version of the character ; so everything is larger than life . she 's one of the nicest disney dolls i 've seen in a while.definitely one for the disney fanatic in your life !

> 1988 's over the edge is the first full-length album from hurricane , which featured vocal powerhouse kelly hansen ( who would later go on to front unruly child and foreigner ) . hurricane 's style was somewhere between warrant and house of lords . it was hard hitting , but very melodic.the songs on over the edge stuck pretty close to the love song/rock anthem formula that was so common with these kinds of bands , but never got too clich & eacute ; d - there 's no `` cherry pie '' moment here . all of the songs are fairly strong , but the cover of alice cooper 's `` i 'm eighteen '' and the catchy as hell single `` i 'm on to you '' are the album 's highlights . over the edge 's odd moments are the extraordinarily poppy `` give me an inch '' and the `` hidden '' final track `` baby snakes '' , which is essentially a guy repeatedly calling ( stalking ? ) a girl on the phone while hurricane 's music plays in the background.overall , this is a very good album , and one that most hair metal/melodic rock fans will want to hear , especially now that it has been reissued . not only is this previously impossible to find cd back in print , but it features crystal clear digitally remastered sound . if you already have over the edge on cd and are wondering whether this reissue is worthwhile , believe me when i say that the remastering is nothing short of incredible.note : the cd comes housed in a mini-lp style package . it 's essentially a slightly oversized cardboard sleeve with the disc enclosed in an interior envelope with brief liner notes . i 'm not a huge fan of this kind of packaging ( it does n't do a great job protecting the cd ) , but i have to admit that it is ideal for showcasing the album cover artwork , and as you can see hurricane 's album covers are worthy of the extra attention !
= great album , amazing remaster
< 4.5 stars ... very good album , but not great

> `` from paris with love '' made me laugh , not because it was a spy comedy , but it was so awful it was laughable . if anything it is just immature hijinks for a targeted audience of 13 year old boys . ( it is entirely possible a 13 year old could have written this script in a day . ) the plot is all over the place and the wan na be spies are as goofy as circus clowns.john travolta must have needed the money to accept this script he plays charlie wax , a wild and crazy bad boy the cia worships for his unorthodox ways of getting things done . the movie had some potential to be a clever spoof , but it had bland lines , standard shoot-outs and chases and so much fake blood and dead bodies you looked at your watch , hoping there was a story line between killing terrorists , chases and tough-guy blabbering ( e.g . `` wax on , wax off '' ? ? ) jonathan rhys meyers plays james reese , his sidekick and protege from the american embassy in paris . reese has been doing perfunctory spy chores but he wants to do the important work like charlie . when charlie arrives in paris with his shiny shaved head , earring in one ear and leather jacket , foaming at the mouth because he is detained at the airport for carrying a soft drinks through customs , we see james rescue him . they become a modern day laurel and hardy partnership . travolta struts his tough-guy stuff while rhys meyers is flapping around sputtering his angst as explosions , shoot-outs and mayhem continue without stop . together they get involved with terrorists , suicide bombers , drug runners and double-dealing girlfriends.the movie is just jaw-dropping awful parody .

> former child prodigy anne-sophie mutter went on to become the glam lady in low-cut dresses . now she 's a mature musician and an acknowledged star . but she 's also well known for her impulse toward over-refined , fussy playing . here she starts off with a strike against her -- the slack , lifeless introduction to the first movement from masur . ( whatever miracle david hurwitz hears in masur 's conducting has occurred in his own head . ) then mutter enters , and the level of musicianship rises dramatically . her strong , assured playing holds the stage immediately . compared to violinists whose ideas i admire ( kremer , menuhin , vengerov , oistrakh , shaham ) she is a `` personality '' violinist who draws attention to herself at every moment . that said , mutter carries you along , and her tone and technique are impeccable , at times mesmerizing.after a first movement that could use more pace , the second is at normal speed ( timing 9:20 ) and begins with lovely oboe work from the ny phil 's first chair . mutter plays with a warm , burnished tone , and although she inflects the melody more than anyone else i 've heard , her notions are appealing . she begins the finale forcefully , and at a timing of 7:55 the pace is moderate . masur has waked up by now , and their collaboration produces the first real sparks of the performance . mutter remains fully in charge to the end , helped by close-up miking that makes her louder than the orchestra.in all , a good outing that should satisfy her legion of fans . the absence of a fifth star is entirely masur 's doing .

> this collection is incredible . it features a few of the very favorites ( duck amuck , dock dodgers , three bears ) plus hours of others . i suppose you could complain that it 's not back-to-back personal favorites , but wb needs to make future collections attractive , too.and the 'lesser ' cartoons are still good ones . tortose wins shows all the craftmanship that went into the early ` toons , especially in the background art . baseball bugs shows just how literary these pieces were . way in the background , up there on the outfield fence , is an ad for filboid studge - h. h. munroe fans will surely recognize that one.i like the mix of early and late , different characters starring , and the best-known with the less-remembered work . it shows me a lot about the animation styles of different times and bugs development as a character ( esp . from elmer 's candid camera ) . the later backgrounds were n't as artful , for example . even so , these ` toons are loads better than the ones that followed . there was a steady degradation of artwork and complexity , sliding down through the late 50s , then , with exceptions , plummeting through the 70s.it 's just good clean fun , silly puns in the titles , and a dose of personal nostalgia . the wwii-era cartoons also show an interesting slice of modern american history , how that war pervaded civilian life in ways that none since have been able to . those really were different times.//wiredweird

'' does n't cure-all ills . we will definitely be seeing more of them in the next book.this is definitely a novella that works , with enough backstory to keep it from being too rushed and enough to look forward to keep it from ending too abruptly . no question , this is one to read.rating : 4heat rating : sweetreviewed by : monique neaves

> i have not heard sam harris sing but i would like to do so . these essays cover his life as a gay man in the music entertainment world . he is liza minnelli 's best friend and some of this stories are about her . although these are all very good , my absolute favorite is about his being stiffed by aretha franklin . he is hired as her opening act in cleveland . when she finally shows up for rehearsal , she shows up in full diva mode . she treats harris like dirt maybe in part because the young audience wants to hear him more than her , she does n't let him rehearse ! she behaves like a complete brat and then she does n't even pay him or his expenses . the amazing part is that harris does n't care . he has always been a huge fan of her voice and he 's happy he got to work with her even though she and her people act horribly . my next favorite is about how he sings on oprah after 9/11 to help the nation heal . oprah let 's him get close because of the emotional level of the experience . finally , his piece about liza 's disastrous last marriage and its aftermath is terrific . now i just have to hear him sing ! ! ! ! !

> the shore 's cd creates dreamy pop landscapes . the opener `` hard road '' has ben ashley 's aching vocals melting over rick porter 's guitar , `` have faith in this light flowin ' through windows at dawn , but the seasons will change & i 've never felt so alone .

'' `` different ways '' also sets a similar groove with the dense guitars washing slowly behind ben ashley 's vocals , `` i can feel it coming on like a hurricane . '' of course , it 's one of the slower hurricanes , which would be my only complaint about this set . i would have liked a few flat out rockers thrown into the mix to pep it up a bit . `` hold on '' comes closest to fitting that bill and has some nice beach boys airy harmonies thrown in . the shore sound is melodic and dreamy , a great debut . enjoy !

> i read the book last week with the idea of buying several copies as christmas gifts . i was disappointed at what seemed to be the `` speed '' at which is was written so that some facts that even i knew were incorrect . i 've read about five books about lincoln and found nothing really new in this one . the `` thriller '' way it was presented did keep my attention in some points but then one glaring error would pop up ( such as where mary surrett was imprisoned ) and i 'd find myself looking for more . i think the book was done in haste to get it out to o'reilly 's public . i liked his first books , some insightful views on his part , but i think he missed the mark on this one . i also think his adoration of lincoln was too apparent . nobody but jesus has ever been perfect but bill makes lincoln sound as if he were and he never made crucial mistakes . it 's okay to read but do n't think i 'll be buying it for my history teacher son . . . he 'd have a fit !

> o'reilly and dugard both admit to being christian believers , and it would be even more difficult to write this book if they were not . non-christians would have exhibited more skepticism ; these men do not . while they go to great lengths to avoid describing the miracles which made jesus famous , they aver that they did happen , or at least that thousands of people believed in them . those thousands made jesus ia concern to the powers that be of the time.the story is at its best when dealing with the political atmosphere , detailing the uneasy relationship between the romans and the jewish hierarchy which finally led to the ex 's . everyone , except , perhaps jesus , was terrified of the power of the emperor a thousand miles away , and every action centered on what might be reported to tiberius.excellent book . made the human side of jesus apparent and tried hard to separate fact from legend . the book enlightens the reader , regardless of belief , on the harsh and violent times which spawned a religion which has survived two millennia and is still going strong .

> words & music : john mellencamp 's greatest hits is the definative collection his music . spanning mr. mellencamp 's entire career , the set culls together the varying phases of his career . mr. mellencamp is often thought of as knockoff of other artists , but his personal tales of life in america 's heartland show he has his own unique voice . songs like `` pink houses '' , `` cherry bomb '' , `` authority song '' , `` now more than ever '' , `` human wheels '' , `` paper in fire '' , 'martha say '' , `` jackie brown '' & `` your life is now '' are strong statement songs . mr. mellencamp can also write a great rock song like `` hurts so good '' , `` r.o.c.k . in the u.s.a.

> the manfred symphony is considered by man to be a major misfire by tchiakovsky , a stepchild to his six symphonies that feels diffuse and banal -- bernstein called it `` trashy '' and the great evgeny mravinsky never seems to have recorded it over his very long career . but riccardo chailly makes the work involving by paying precise attention to every detail of balance and phrasing . this would be too fussy in many other works , but it helps give manfred moment-to-moment interest . the engineers have helped even more by giving chailly spectcular sonics that make every bar sound gorgeous.if you want an exciting manfred , go for toscanini 's unsurpassed studio recording from 1949 ( in surprisingly good sound ) or the naxos bargain version with vasily petrenko and the royal liverpool phil. , which of course lacks the world-class sheen and polish of the concertgebouw . if you 're doubtful about the work to begin with , this decca cd is good enough to satisfy .

> at first glance , the title of this unusual story is misleading . the secret is nothing like what one might expect a husband 's secret to be , not an affair or some naughty little confession . liane moriarty seduces the reader with glimpses into the lives of two women , unconnected , both of them leading what they think are perfect lives . then there is the third woman , still grieving the death of her daughter , decades after the seventeen-year-old was murdered . how the author entwines the lives of these women and other intregal characters is magic . near the end of the book , when i realized what janie 's mother was about to do , i caught my breath , dreading the moment , even as i watched it unfold . story-telling at it 's best .

> robocop is a classic 80 's action movie . robocop 2 should have been a decent sequel , after all the screen play was written by frank miller , the guy responsible for revitalizing batman , and it was directed by irvin kershner ( the empire strikes back ) . unfortunately , the movie is n't all that great . kershner did a decent job with what material he had , but he did n't have much . the movie is dry and lacks the empathy and humor of the original . in fact , the film is basically a complete rehash of the original ( without the origins of robocop ) . therefore , instead of a classic 80 's action film , robocop 2 is just an average nihilistic action flick .
= just an average action flick

> denzel , knavely to clever to be understood is best suited for action adventure yarns like the book of eli in which he sparkled.he has the credibility credentials to be an action hero . his considerable talents should be employed in good , interesting adventures not in stuffy drama about an airplane accident . consider the flight a bore . a lengthy dullard . its only merit being the beast with two backs ripped from shakespeare 's othello.lasted 20 minutes with this bore before i dropped the view . the interracial romance , what i saw of it was well handled and tasteful . that topic is something i do n't particularly like .

> this shampoo-conditioner worked fine as a product . it has a slight spicy smell and is a jelly like green substance.the problem comes as the shampoo level goes down . the bottle is too thick to squeeze easily , the opening is small and the cap is rounded so that you can not stand the bottle upside down and let the shampoo run to the opening . it 's just awkward to get the shampoo out once it hits the halfway level . you also need a fingernail to raise the lid.it 's a difficult bottle to use easily ; that sort of outweighs the good shampoo inside .

> these smead supertab two-pocket lockit folders are an answer to a prayer and may change the way i file some items . these are perfect for doing a great job of holding things like receipts and check stubs in the folder instead of having them fly out when that folder is being taken out of the file cabinet , in use , or on the way back to the file cabinet.it 's also nice for separating the types of documents inside the folder . letters on one side and bills , order forms , packing slips , etc . on the other side.these really are wonderful .

> if you are into speculation concerning parallel universes of many possible types , and unified field theory ; plus current physical ( mathematical ) models of the universe this book will tweak ( for you engineering types ) or pique your curiosity of what could be . the author lays out the multiple sometimes overlapping , sometimes conflicting and frequently limited models of the universe that exist in current mathematical theory.the book beckons the reader to carefully read and analyze concepts presented in this book.highly recommend for people who are prone to thinking about such things .

> the major event the fall of the soviet union which prompted this work was a true historical turning point . fukuyama took the world by storm by seeing it as sign of an inevitable triumph of liberal democracy . for a time it appeared to some that he might be right . but as he was now fifteen years later see a world torn apart by radical islamic terrorism , a world in which tribal loyalties increasingly surface as most important , a world in which the possibilities of terror and destruction multiply exponentially with the perfection of technology fukuyama 's thesis seems a utopian kind of ivory - tower dream . fukuyama is a tremendously learned , intelligent and skillful master of his argument- but the argument itself and the fundamental thesis has gone the way of so many other ' inevitability theories ' we could conceivably all go down in a second of doom brought on by any of a number of different human and non- humanly generated events . liberal democracy may well be the best kind of government mankind has ever known but it certainly does not seem bound to conquer necessarily the masses of mankind , even as now when certain very large portions of mankind , china , for instance are moving ahead by leaps and bounds economically.this is a tremendously thought- provoking work , and highly recommended . it would have been nice if its major thesis had come true .

> it is difficult to categorise earl 's musical style . some of his songs sound more traditional than others , but they are all of a remarkably high quality . earl sings mostly love ballads , sometimes sad and sometimes philosophical . he never seems to get really excited , so you wo n't find any up-tempo rockers here . he wrote most of his own songs and i wonder if he found true happiness in love because his songs seem to suggest not.earl smoked heavily , which gave his voice a distinctive quality but ultimately took its toll and he had to quit the music business for a while . before doing so , had about thirty hits on the country chart , of which twenty are to be found here . seventeen of these tracks were number one hits , the exceptions being heavenly bodies , i have loved you girl but not like this before and the duet with keith whitley , brotherly love . the only missing number one hit is we believe in happy endings , a duet with emmylou harris.this is a wonderful collection of earl 's music . i hope to see another compilation featuring the hits that did n't make it here , but with all those number one hits on it , this will remain just what the title says - the essential earl thomas conley .

> these are all wonderful movies . the original films were each and every one of them classics . each of these movies moves along at breakneck pace with a well-thought-out storyline , great acting , great direction , perfect special effects , and the works.i did n't get much out of the & quot ; extras & quot ; with this set , but who cares ? the dvds are of ultra-high-quality and look great on my 40 inch sony progressive scan tv screen . let 's be honest : harrison ford , sean connery & amp ; co. are so good in these films that & quot ; extras & quot ; are not needed . i 'm sure many afficianados will enjoy the various extra features , but to be honest i 'm just into the movies . they are great ! ! the wonderful thing about these films is that they have aged not just well but superbly . & quot ; raiders of the lost ark & quot ; has as much impact , wonder , and adventure as it did when i first saw it in the theater in 1981. the same goes for temple of doom and last crusade.we 've all been waiting for this set to arrive and here it is !

> i have also tried thesafer brand 05140 the pantry pest trap , 2 moth trapsand this seems to be the same product in different packaging . it is a tent-shaped piece of cardboard that is sticky on the inside . it comes with with a lure packet that you open and place a small square-shaped piece of lure onto the sticky part of the cardboard . the lure is suppose to lure moths to the sticky patch and the moths get stuck and trapped.the lure/sticky combo works fairly well . i have quite a few moths in the trap but i 'm not overly impressed with the results.for this particular productsafer brand 07270 clothes moth alert trap , it is only to alert you to moth activity and does not address the problem of moths damaging your clothes.this is on the package - note : this product is designed to alert you to a potential problem , and is designed to trap adult moths , not the larvae which do the actual damage.right on the box , they state that it does nothing for your problem except alert you to moth activity . for me , seeing damage or actual moths flying around is just as effective and much cheaper .

> i got this screen protector for my kindle keyboard . i needed a screen protector and this one does the job . most importantly , the visibility of the screen is not reduced . i find reading just as easy as normal.however , it 's not perfect . the instructions have you apply the screen protector starting from the bottom-left corner , but for right-handed individuals it 's tricky to get it straight . i also found it tough to get rid of all of the air bubbles . finally , the screen protector is just a bit too small for the screen , meaning the outer edge is n't flush with the black portion of the kindle.overall , this is n't a bad option , but there 's room for improvement .

> i 'm already into season 2. although the plot is the good guy over the bad , all characters , not just the main one , give superb performances . you have to like the `` cowboy '' protagonist to enjoy the type of story . however , a careful watch of his face is what i like : raised eyebrow , eyes swish sideways , sly smile . the story lines are a wee bit different from usual shows of this type , but the characters grow on you . i hate to know the last season 6 will be the ending of this fun series .

> there was a time when plenty of country singers had twangy nasal voices , but those voices limited their appeal . it did n't stop loretta lynn , tammy wynette and others having plenty of success , and it did n't appear to be stopping dolly parton , but she worked hard to change her voice as anybody who has listened to her music from different periods of her career would have noticed . so we come to valerie june , who does n't quite sound like any of her predecessors , although i detect echoes of iris dement and kitty wells here and there.valerie wrote or co-wrote all but one of the songs , which also appears to be original . on two tracks ( shotgun , twisted and twined ) she sings and plays guitar without any other musicians . a third track ( trials , troubles , tribulations ) finds valerie just singing to a musician playing guitar and providing male backing vocals.elsewhere , more instruments are used but not many on any given track . there is a trumpet player on the opening track ( workin ' woman blues ) . valerie plays ukulele while singing on two other tracks ( on my way , somebody to love ) .this is a great album if you like country music sung by a woman with a twangy nasal voice . it wo n't be to everybody 's liking , but it is to mine .

> hmm . does this product use the multiple input multiple output [ mimo ] approach that has been proposed for various new wireless devices ? sure sounds like it . multibeam seems like belkin 's implementation of this idea . which basically says that while using a single antenna for transmitting or receiving runs into fundamental limitations like channel capacity [ aka . shannon 's various seminal theorems ] , why not then try several antennas . the wonder is that this was not more commonly done earlier in consumer electronics wireless products . though i guess that composing the signal to transmit , and reconstructing the received signal across several antennas is very intricate , and needed till now to be practical and economic in a relatively low cost device.at any rate , you certainly do not need a degree in electrical engineering to install and understand how to use this product.what is also interesting to me is how the box claims that the device can prioritise network traffic , using a quality of service approach . is this the same qos as backbone routers and switches on the internet might use ? i was unable to test this aspect of the device , unfortunately . but it presumably is meant for real time activities like voip , where jitter can really degrade the user experience .

> virginia madsen is perfect as the driven researcher , trying to find out the history of a modern , urban boogeyman called candyman . she is fearless in her obsession with him and knows no limits in getting the story . this includes searching through the crumbling catacombs of the infamous cabrini green housing project . this is ultimately her undoing , as the candyman turns out to be real , and does n't like her lack of respect . he begins to mess with her life in nasty ways , framing her for horrible crimes , while luring her deeper into a cat and mouse game with life shattering consequences . tony todd is candyman . his voice is even scarier than his hooks for hands ! this movie is disturbing because you do n't know what extremes he 'll go to , or what he 'll do next . he 's supernatural and not afraid to destroy a person in order to get their attention ! madsen 's character goes into a downward spiral that made me cringe , and all she really did was doubt the candyman 's existence . he 's one frightening guy ! a gruesome masterpiece . watch this one alone in the dark ...

> an original thought : carl denham ( robert armstrong ) , shameless huckster that he is who risks the lives of the unwitting for his own personal glory , should have took the bullets instead of kong . instead , he gets to mouth empty platitudes about beauty killing the beast over poor exploited kong 's dead body . the cops should have slapped the cuffs on him for putting the general public in harm 's way . now that i 've got that off my chest i can extoll the virtues of `` king kong '' . this film is not only a technological marvel but an exciting edge of your seat adventure film . this is a slam dunk with the convergence of great storytelling and excellent technical craftmanship adding up to a timeless masterpiece . the creatures designed for this film by willis o'brien are so expressive and lifelike that they have more character than the human actors . i 'm hoping that peter jackson 's upcoming remake has a fraction of the original 's inventiveness .

> i am always impressed by tom waits ' descriptive ability - the way he paints vignettes of people and places and moods . his early work on the asylum label is generally more accessible than later stuff like bone machine and here the listener finds waits in a gentle frame of mind on a tasty selection of mainly soft ballads and jazzy numbers like blue valentines and the duet i never talk to strangers . i prefer his country style ballads so tom traubert 's blues ( waltzing matilda ) and ruby 's arms are my favourites . this is a good introduction to his bluesy musical vision contained in that gravely voice and his evocative story songs , but i think it would have been better if masterpieces like the piano 's been drinking ( not me ) , i hope that i do n't fall in love with you , old 55 and saving all my love for you had been included . i also recommend his albums heartattack and vine and swordfishtrombones .

= great visit to the original batman !
< awesome !

> innocent little crimes byt c. s. lakin missed for me . this story of revenge just never grabbed me . i never got into the characters . who cared for their fate . i think the problem was the beginning , we met too many too fast and then lila starts and crazy she is . lakin can write but needs to slow down and set thngs up with more detail . missed its mark.note : a copy of the book was given to me in return for a impartial review .

> pup pup gets adopted by amy morford is a really sweet story about two children that are lucky enough to get a puppy , or rather `` pup pup ! '' zac and scarlett are adorable kids that get to go through the excitement of actually picking out a pup for their very own . my kids were hanging off every word . the illustrations are excellent and we really ca n't wait to read the next one . definitely gets a thumbs up from me ! : )
= my kid 's loved it !
< sweet story !

> thank you ms. stockett for starting a dialogue . i am finding the reader reviewsof this book even more engaging and enlightening than the book itself . particularly when i am able to discern where and when the reviewer grew up and his or her race/ethnicity . i was born in california in the1970 's and always have been shocked at the events still occurring in this country just a few years before my birth . and they still go on just perhaps not so openly .
= thank you ms. stockett

> the writer has a great premise for a novel but i found the story repetitive and kept skipping parts of it . the thought that the novel would not actually end , that it was part of a trilogy , kept nagging me as well . i enjoyed the author 's style but lost interest in the story about two-thirds of the way through , skipped ahead to read the ending , and decided not to continue with the next book .
= okay thriller

> red heart super saver yarn in candy print knitted up to be the cutest toddler 's hat ever . i crocheted on some contrasting trim , and the result was awesome.this yarn might seem just a trifle stiff when you first finish your project , but i guarantee that one quick wash with some fabric softener will make it absolutely luscious.i am ultra-satisfied with this yarn and would use it again for another project !

> this self-titled offering from the bird and the bee is eclectic , to say the least . vocalist and songwriter inara george ( the bird ) and multi-instrumentalist greg kurstin ( the bee ) put together a collection of ten sophisticated and elegant poppish songs incorporating a variety of styles . the end product is musical , complex and rather strange sounding . it 's a very unusual and original-sounding album . one of a kind . it 's somewhat retro and somewhat `` jazzy . '' in places the harmonies sound somewhat like the beach boys or sixties girl groups . interesting mix.the voice of inara george is one of the highlights of the album . she comes across as charming and sultry . i looked her up on the internet and , sure enough , she looks the part . my lady friend says she reminds her of chan marshall . hmmmm . well , the voice is somewhat similar but the styles and content are much different . i really enjoy listening to her , but there 's a certain limited range and sameness from song to song and it gets a bit tiresome listening to a whole album without a break . that 's a weak criticism , i suppose . i 'd say the songs are great but might benefit by being intermixed with other music . another mild criticism i have has to do with some of the lyrics . `` f*cking boyfriend , '' in particular comes to mind . i have nothing against such songs , but i find myself having to be careful of playing the disc before certain people.kurstin wraps the irony-filled vocals with keyboard lines and rhythmic beats . altogether , the music is rather simple , but it shimmers and shakes . the album is very original , refreshing and listenable , over and over . it 's a charming and delightful cd , but i 'd give it only four stars because of the listed problems.gary peterson

> this is not a faithful reproduction of dune the novel . as with all blockbuster books , a film interpretation that is literal to the plot is almost impossible . editing the plot down to a manageable 2 or 3 hours means plenty of & quot ; expository lumps & quot ; as ursula le guin calls them . these are the over-voice narrations or worse , scrolling text , to let a viewer figure out what the script writer left out of the film.having said all that , lynch 's film is not a bad one . the choice of ornatic , victorian gothic costuming gives the flavor of future feudal-imperial caladan and arrakis , a universe with dukes , barons and emperors . jurgen prochnow ( of das boot fame ) , francesca annis , kyle maclachlan , patrick stewart and sian philips are a magnificent , capable cast.the over-the-top baron and feyd ( played by sting ) are evocative of the obsessive , perverse duo in the book if not faithful to the actual portrayal . the heart-plugs , sewn into the baron 's slave flunkies , is a chilling visual interpretation of the baron 's sadistic pleasures.my only quarrel is really with the screenplay adaptation . the voice-activated weapon ( a merging of voice , the commanding use of voice by bene gesserit and the duke 's superb training . ) it seems a feeble idea to me . the bene gesserit are really not well explained . however , the director 's cut version is a reasonably good film in itself and worth watching .

> in `` plumb island '' nelson demille introduced the world to nypd detective john corey , and this is easily my favorite detective novel of all time . indeed , it is one of the best reads you are ever likely to find . `` the lion game '' was a sequel , and while it was a fine novel , it was not in the same league as `` plumb island , '' which was admittedly a hard act to follow . in `` the lion '' demille again gets pretty much everything right , and the magic is back . this is the story of the return of terrorist asad khalil , and it does not disappoint . the story is fast-paced , rarely slows down , and even when it does it retains the reader 's interest . i really enjoyed this one . `` the lion '' keeps the reader on pins and needles for most of the novel , and much of it is truly of page-turning quality . demille really seems to understand the nature of the national anti-terrorist effort , and one can only hope that we have lots of real-life john coreys looking after our safety.the kindle edition is nicely formatted and has none of the issues that a few kindle renditions have had.some of demille 's more recent works have been too long and too meandering . in `` the lion '' this issue vanishes . no fan of demille is likely to be disappointed by this one . highly recommended . rjb .

> jenna hart needs a change of pace , so she is leaving behind a successful advertising career in san francisco to move home to crystal cove , on the central california coast . she is helping her aunt vera open up a bookstore focusing on cookbooks . for their grand opening , they 've got desiree , jenna 's college roommate and a popular host of a food network show.desiree is very high maintenance and pushy , usually getting her own way . but jenna does n't expect to discover desiree murdered on the beach the morning after desiree arrives in town . with the local busy body ready to proclaim jenna guilty to anyone who will listen , jenna decides to find the killer herself to clear her name . but who did desiree irritate enough to kill her ? i enjoyed this debut . the characters are fun , and i enjoyed spending time with them . the plot moved forward at a steady pace with lots of twists that kept me guessing about the killer until the end.however , there were some flaws . first , jenna learns some family history over the course of the book , but i found it hard to believe she never knew it before . second , there seemed to be some timing issues with a few clues and motives.i 'm looking forward to seeing what jenna and her friends are cooking up next . fans of culinary cozies will want to start this new series .

> i just wish tony hillerman could write faster . i seem to need a dose of a new book by him about twice a year.his books featuring leaphorn and chee , for me , are the best of the lot , so sinister pig goes right to the top of the list.here 's the thing : hillerman and his editors know anything he writes is going to sell like thermal longjohns in alaska . but still , his books read like they 've actually been edited and checked and coddled a bit.sinister pig deals with murder - of course - dum-de-dum-dum : otherwise , it would n't be a hillerman mystery . it also deals with lots and lots of $ $ $ missing from the tribal trust , drugs , greed , and hanky-panky on the 'rez . ' i just wish janet whatzername , chee 's first love interest , had n't vanished from the series so early ... here comes bernadette manuelito , however , to take up the slack.do n't miss it - but here 's the thing lots of casual readers do n't realize : you can take a hillerman book , a topographical map of the four corners area , and a 4-wheel drive vehicle , and actually track down every single rock and arroyo and mesa and creek that 's mentioned . trust me : i 've done it .

> my dish is an often-used one in my home . i make dishes ranging from quiche to italian-style frittata and its spanish cousin tortilla espa & ntilde ; ola . it 's the perfect size for small dinners of two or three , and i even use this as a preparation and serving bowl for meze and antipasti , and serving fruit salads and fresh vegetable platters . when not in use i have it on my dining table with fresh fruit.the ten inch diameter size is perfect for the smaller gatherings i host , but works when i want to make a frittata for myself and enjoy the left overs for a day or two . this is not a lightweight piece . i am guessing that it weights close to three pounds.although i use mine for slower cooking dishes , you can go to 425 degrees ( f ) in an oven . it 's also dishwasher safe . one final advantage is the finish is practically non-stick , especially if you 'grease ' it with a little oil or butter before cooking with it . the final thing i love is the color . white goes with just about any decor , but my serving ware is all white so it fits my home perfectly . i love mine so much that i purchased two - just in case .

> yep , get those fallout shelters dug and those lead suits pressed ! it 's time for the atomic cafe ! culled from archival footage and spliced together to make the best presentation of the nuclear nightmare i 've ever seen . watch as politicians talk about the benefits and wonders of the hydrogen bomb ! see ordinary folks being lulled to sleep by official propoganda ! listen to the military brass tell their troops about the minor threat of the live nuke test they are about to experience up close ! hear the pure balogna told to the poor natives of the bikini atoll , just before the test blast that would bring tons of radiation raining down on their smiling heads ! this is more than a movie , it 's a damning slice of history . nothing gets across the vastness of our own insanity like our own words and actions ! the atomic age becomes the atomic culture as we live in fear of the russians and the bomb . most of the statements by politicians and military types are so ridiculous , it 's as though they were scripted by mel brooks ! the true horror of this movie lies in it 's presentation of real people saying and doing irrational , stupid things . watch it and tremble ...

> i 'm 56 years old and this program represents film art for the current generation of more youthful viewers.to me , the firefly series is sort of a three-way cross betweenstar trek : the next generation - complete series , ( from a story standpoint ) ; doctor who : the e-space trilogy - full circle/state of decay/warriors ' gate ( episodes 112-114 ) , ( for its `` soap opera-ish '' approach to film ) , and ; c.s.i . crime scene investigation - the complete first season , ( from the perspective of `` production '' . ) i 'm a traditionalist , always preferring older movies and tv series over the newer productions , but i heard so much about firefly that i thought i 'd give it a shot ; however , i could n't deal with the abrupt scene changes and camera sweeps , a film production technique that emerged from the 90s.but , in summary , it 's still easy to see that this is quality programming , supported by terrific writers . so , in the end , just because i did n't personally enjoy firefly does not mean that others wo n't appreciate a good show when they see it ... thus my five-star rating .

> yesterday flipping around the channels i hit upon white christmas , that old chestnut ( 1954 ) starring danny kaye , bing crosby , rosemary clooney , dean jagger , and dancer vera-ellen . i first saw this movie as a child , long , long ago , and have never forgotten that final scene with the entire cast in red and white , singing the title song with snow floating down all around . magical . today , the plot is , well , nothing less than corny , but you 've got to hand it to the stars - they were talented , show biz pros . vera-ellen 's dancing was amazing , and the sound track contains such classics as `` count your blessings '' , `` sisters '' . watch it for some old fashioned sentimentality , nostalgia , and post wwii can-do americanism . it 's a lot of fun , even the preposterous parts ( breaking into song at the railway station , for instance , or expecting the general to have been intimately acquainted with privates kaye and crosby . ) and oh , that vistavision ! ! !

> leave it to stephen king to make us feel goosebumps when we hear the previously harmless i 'm a little teapot . in spite of the film 's length , director craig baxley keeps the suspense and underlying terror moving in this excellent stephen king movie . not inspired by a book , king gives us his trademark setting and characters and a villain whose sheer malevolence oozes from the screen . the pacing of the storm itself is in syncrhonicity with the townspeople 's growing fear , and after discovering what mr. linoge wants from them , this heinous act comes easily to the frightened townspeople . the cast is marvelous : tim daly is perfect as the town constable and moral backbone . we see him go from a measured self-confidence to a bewildered victim of his own community ; debrah farentino is wonderful as his wife , molly , whose tenacious perseverance crumbles as the storm and linoge become fiercer ; casey sieszmasko as daly 's friend and deputy has a naivete and innocence that crumbles easily under the gaze of linoge ; jeffrey demunn takes the stereotypical blowhard town manager and infuses a complex portrait of a man 's guilt and desire to be in charge . a cast of lesser known actors ( at least to me ) are well chosen and bring life to the town 's citizens . linoge 's exposition of all their darkest secrets is bonechilling . that brings us to colm feore , the actor wisely chosen to portray this demonic villain . using his oddly handsome face to show both contempt and control , feore dominates all his scenes and makes us wish only the worst for him.the resolution of this movie is typically dark , so do n't expect to come away feeling chipper . if you 're a fan of king 's or of spooky movies , this one 's a grabber .

> for all those who suffered through thucydides ' long ( and incomplete ) history of the peloponnesian war somewhere in their schooling , rejoice . acclaimed classical historian donald kagan , author of the current definitive work on the subject , has provided a `` popular '' history that really is accessible to the general reader.in the fifth century b.c. , the rival states of athens and sparta , and their allies , waged a three decade-long war that would devastate the greek world and end a golden era of progress and prosperity begun by the defeat of a persian invasion just a half-century before . the history of the conflict is a microcosm of politics and policy , human hubris and human error , and proof that very little has changed in human nature in all the centuries since . kagan 's narrative illuminates the long war without overwhelming the reader . he explores the causes and conduct of the war and the disasters it initiated . the parallels to more recent conflicts , such as the first world war , cold war , and even the global war on terrorism , will be apparent to the thoughtful reader . the peloponnesian war is broken down into event-oriented segments , liberally supplemented by maps . a short concluding bibliograpic essay details kagan 's broad array of sources . `` the peloponnesian war '' is still around 500 pages , a daunting length recommended to those with a real interest in the topic , or an interest in bypassing thucydides .

> how many times have parents said that to their kids ? well , this book proves that it can be good advice.the result of a bet with his publisher over whether he could create a book with a plot with only 50 words , this dr. seuss classic finds us following an argument between an unnamed character and sam-i-am . sam wants the other character to try green eggs and ham , and the other character refuses . sam keeps asking him to try to in new places or with new things , but he always refuses . will he give in ? what will happen when he does ? okay , so the limited number of words means the book gets repetitive . every refusal includes everything that 's been said before . but in true dr. seuss fashion , the rhythm and rhymes make it so much fun . i read this book to my niece this weekend , and i was n't ready for it to end . the words are all easy enough that a beginning reader should have no trouble with them , if they do n't already have the book memorized.and dr. seuss 's fun illustrations certainly help . they are stylized as always , but they work to convey the story.this is definitely a classic from the pen of dr. seuss . it belongs in every kid 's collection .

> unfortunately , stewart townsend ca n't act . unfortunately , ms. theron was bored when this film was shot . very unfortunately , the great actress penelop cruz had disconnected for the most parts of this movie , cause her character died which was a disappointed . i wished penelop would of played the slut but , i understand she could n't cause in real life penelop cruz was born in france.the photography is lovely and the scene with two rabbits on leashes was fresh and amusing . but that 's not a reason to see this film.thomas kretschmann is the only reason to watch this film and his final scene as ms. theron 's german officer lover is marvelous and get-wrenching . now thomas kretschmann can act ! for a movie that was base on the 1930 's which had them fighting in world war 2 , it showed some of the most weakest fighting i 've ever scene . it was not enough blood , guts , action or special effects and the movie was already rated r cause of the slutty german whore , the at least charlize theron could of had this ww2 fighting in this movie to look more like ( saving private ryan ) , that movie looked more realistic .

> most of you already know the story - an attempt on adolph hitler 's life during the final year of world war ii . it 's a historically-faithful film to what really happened , so that 's a big plus . most times , much of these `` based on a true event '' stories are mostly fiction . not here.anyway , what people with blu-ray players want to know is how does this look and sound ? it looks very good and sounds terrific . the colors are rich and most scenes are very sharp . a few are slightly soft but i think those were intentional . overall , it 's a pretty film with very little cgi . all the production values are excellent in re-creating the period.the sound was particularly impressive considering there was very little action . most of it takes place in the beginning of the film . most of the movie is talk , but you can hear voices out of all speakers and get terrific surround sound on odd things like a room full of typewriters clicking away . overall , the audio was extremely impressive .

> well , though i love the way this mason jar feeder looks in comparison to some other hummingbird feeders , i have yet to see any hummingbirds use this . it sparkles nicely in the sunlight , and is pleasant to look at - but it would be even prettier with some hummingbirds making use of it ! my only consolation is that i have not seen insects using it either.after a week of inactivity , i called my uncle who gardens quite a bit and he told me to up the ratio of sugar-to-water to 3:1 - so i have tried that , but still have n't seen any . i do n't know if it is just the location of my backyard , or if the news of this feeder has n't hit the hummingbirds yet ... because i like the way it looks , i will continue to hang it - but if after another few weeks of inactivity , i may stop fiddling with cleaning it and filling it - resigning myself to the fact that this will be for decoration only . at least it 's pretty ...

> yes , the `` fifty shades '' trilogy is total smutty trash . yes , it 's a total rip-off of the `` twilight '' series . yes , most of the plot is entirely predictable . no , there is nothing literary about these books whatsoever ... and yet i absolutely love them ! `` fifty shades darker '' was even better than `` fifty shades of grey , '' if you can believe that 's possible . there is just something about these two characters . the love story of ana and christian just pulls you in right from the beginning . i find that i have actually become desensitized to all the sex scenes because there are so many of them , but the story is really what holds my interest . i can not wait to see what happens in the final installment of the series . if you are looking for something mindlessly entertaining to read , i highly suggest this trilogy . love , love , love it !

> this was a solid western , one of many through the years from clint eastwood , who knows how to make an entertaining film . `` pale rider '' is almost like a modern-day `` shane , '' in which the quiet stranger enters to help the picked-on landowners and then winds up with a showdown with the evil men in town . in this film , eastwood plays a `` preacher , '' ( that 's all he 's called in this movie , but he 's really a gunfighter ) who saves the day for the town miners , led by michael moriarty.there are a lot of mixed moral messages in this film . a couple of things , however , for sure : 1 - the interesting characters ; 2 - the convincing bad guys ; 3 - the beautiful scenery and photography ; 4 - the involving story that makes you care what happens . all of these make this an entertaining film you would watch a number of times .

> a polemic against the wealthy 's exploitation of the poor and middle classcnn anchor lou dobbs does not mince words in this provocative book about the political and business forces that are squeezing the u.s. middle class . he documents an array of government-sponsored abuses , including higher taxes , rising national debt , lost jobs and weaker representative government . both republicans and democrats , he says , are guilty of elevating the needs of corporations over those of u.s. citizens . this is a disturbing message , and dobbs deserves recognition for his dogged reporting , even though his viewers will recognize his usual rants and scapegoats , such as undocumented immigrants . we consider this important reading for anyone interested in learning about what dobbs calls , `` the greatest robbery in u.s . history . '' politicians , lobbyists and corporate leaders may not be happy with what it has to say , but the book will explain why ordinary workers have such a hard time getting ahead .

> though that 's making it seem simpler than it is . imagine pynchon writing about a town divided between white uptown and the aboriginal outskirts . the characters come and go , and the narrative is at turns serious and absurd . but there 's no doubt this is great art , a writer whose words sing from the pages , whose characters compel despite the distance between , and whose storylines divide and merge through a 500 page book that is near impossible to set down.okay , let me moderate my stance , pynchon but with a little more concern for the mortals under the microscope . perhaps a little rushdie or even chekhov in the mix ? regardless , it 's a novel that is not trivial to read , but the rewards are large . a synopsis of the plot would miss the point completely , words and actions , characters and intents flowing by page by page , that 's what the book is about .

> hidden threat has been updated for reissue in 2013. i did not read the original , so have nothing to say in comparison . what i can say is that i found it a very well written romantic suspense . the author walks the balance line between romance well and one is n't sacrificed for the other . her lead couple is strong , multi dimensional and emotionally engaging . the dialogue is appropriate to the setting and the characters . the story was well plotted , the pacing even though fast , and the tension level quite high . i will look for more from this author . *i received my copy from netgalley.com in exchange for an honest review .

> it was all downhill for the band after this album . after the tour during which it was recorded , phil collins would leave the band , they would record the infamous `` calling all stations '' and not too long after that , they split for good . but the `` longs '' installment of this 2-volume set of live material was a glimpse into the greatness of genesis.the premise is pretty basic : six songs exceeding the 6-minute mark ( in fact , five of them go over the 10-minute mark ) , showing off some of the band 's most ellaborate work , to balance off volume one , which focused more on the singles and short songs . starting off the album , standing tall at almost 20 minutes of duration , is a medley of reaaaaaaaly old genesis , where 1975 's `` dance on a volcano '' , 1974 's `` lamb lies down on broadway '' , 1971 's `` musical box '' and 1973 's `` firth of fifth '' and `` i know what i like '' all are brought back to life , if at least for minutes at a time each ... reviving the spirit of one of the world 's best progressive rock bands ever.following the opening track come two tracks from their `` we can dance '' production , along with the `` domino '' bundle ( from their `` invisible touch '' album ) and the `` home by the sea '' bundle ( from their self-titled 1983 album ) . taking it all home is their classic drum duet , featuring phil alongside chester thompson , delivering a massive drum discharge that will electrify you.if you ask me , this last glimpse at their great work is a good as it gets ... i am thankful i had an opportunity of catching them during this tour , back in knebworth , in 1992. they do n't do them like this any more . ; )

( there 's a dave mckean-drawn psa at the end of the book that 's a tad overbearing , but you can probably skip that ; still , mckean is an awe-inspiring artist , and you 'll love the drawings . ) easily on a par with the quality of some of the minor sandman volumes . ***

> this books marks the sad disintegration of the once engaging kay scarpetta series.scarpetta , now heading a forensics academy created by her troubled niece lucy and staffed by former homicide detective marino , is apparently investigating the apparent sucide of a doctor and the ( apparently ) unrelated disappearances of a family and a mother and daughter in florida . scarpetta 's lover is conducting studies of diabolical killers in new england and his examination of one is somehow inexorably linked to the scarpetta investigations . in the mean time , an obnoxious fellow is wreaking havoc upon the relationships at the academy . lucy , who has apparently become a lesbian and is suffering from an operable brain tumor , has a bizarre sexual encounter with a mysterious women and it is all resolved in an unsatisfying manner in the last five pages.none of the characters is even marginally likeable and the chapters are thrown together without any sense of continuity or suspense . removing scarpetta from the morgue was a big mistake and marked the downfall of this series . the ridiculous lucy the super spy antics are as annoying as they are ridiculous . marino has devolved into a moronic , boorish , neanderthal . the characters , once intelligent and realistic , behave so stupidly in this novel it confounds belief . the post mortum on this novel suggests that the author has lost her passion for these characters . that being the case , she might consider laying them to rest ... permanently .

> yes , this is a book directed towards women , but guys can learn a bit from this book also . after all , we also have different roles to balance just as the gals do.as another reviewer points out , this works as a memoir , a self-help book , and a bible study . it starts more as a memoir , with some biblical references , but within a few chapters , gives sound advice on balancing career , being a wife and being a mother , with christian faith as an enveloping connector to all three roles.. not all readers will agree with candace cameron bure 's christian belief , but she 's not preachy about it , so this aspect should n't keep women from reading the book.this is written in a chatty woman to woman manner and is very easy and inspiring reading . many of her biblical references are from the book of proverbs and especially proverbs 31.as i pointed out at the beginning , this is a book that us guys can also get something out of although it appears to be solely written to women . highly recommended .

> 'united 93 ' is the powerful and moving look at the events on september 11th 2001. it focuses on the air traffic control centres that had to deal with the hijacked planes , the military response , as well as the events on flight united 93. i found this film moved very quickly and i was engrossed throughout . you get a real sense of the panic and confusion on that day and it goes some way to showing how difficult it must have been to deal with as it occurred . i was concerned this film would be pro american and biased , but it did n't seem to excessive in that respect and it gave the film all the more impact because of that . i found myself extremely choked up when the passengers on the flight were ringing relatives to say goodbye and could n't even begin to imagine having to do something like that . the ending is full of drama and very powerful and although we have no way of truly knowing every event on that flight , this goes some way to portraying the fears and events that may have occurred . the film is excellently directed , the soundtrack works perfectly to move you and the acting is pretty good as well . highly recommended indeed.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> for all jackie collins fans who have read previous books that star lucky , you 'll be glad to see/read that she 's back . it 's the 6th book involving her and she is quite a character . she 's the kind of woman that all women would like to be because she says what she wants and means and gets away with it all.here she has a 16 year old daughter in this story who is now online meeting perverts and an older guy who says he is 19 without her mom knowing . she is building a new hotel in vegas and has that to deal with . of course no jackie collins book would be complete without a villan ( anthony bonar ) who is someone from her past who 's planning to take everything from her.while i 'm near the end , i 'm reading it at a rapid pace because it 's so trashily addictive . there is something about her books that suck you in and get you hooked . i 'm loving this one and with only 40 pages to go until the end , i want the next lucky santangelo book to come out . this is trash at it 's absolute best .

> the device is a little more complicated to use than a typical loader , however once you get the hang of it you will be amazed at how fast you can load your mags ! i have always just pushed the ammo into the mag using my fingers , and watched my friends use their glock loaders that came with their guns ... my new sig p229 has very strong springs in the mag , and i decided that i needed something to make this process just a bit easier . my friends also used it with their glocks instead of the loader that came with their weapons , one of my friends loved it as he found that he could reload much faster with this item , the other prefered the glock loader as it is less complicated . i have used this on my sig p229 .40 , a glock 19 9mm , and a glock ? ? .40 -- - i paid about $ 12 more for this product at the local gun shop , so the price here on amazon is also a great deal.if you still load your ammunition manually , get one of these ... you will never look back !

> this movie has received a lot of hype and so a first-time viewer is bound to have high expectations . the story concerns john nash , a mathematical genius who also had the misfortune of being a schizophrenic . director ron howard and actor russell crowe attempt to get inside the head of this brilliant and complex man and at some levels , they succeed . they show the difficulties he has making friends in his early days at princeton , and the later effect that his condition has on his marriage . we see him at his best when he comes up with his & quot ; one original idea & quot ; which catapults him from academic disgrace to academic prominence and we see him at his worst when his delusions cause him to be hospitalized and given treatment which today seems barbaric . in spite of the brilliant acting by people with even the samllest parts , at the end of the movie , i felt somewhat empty , as if i had n't gotten the full story , and had received only a glimmer of the truth of the man .

> the bags ! -- these are scented ? fortunately for me i do n't care if they have a scent , because they are pretty much void of odor. -- these are small . we have a jack russell mix and a huge miniature poodle ( 35 pounds ) , and these bags are large enough for their poops , but i think they 'd be inadequate for great dane or shepard poops . to give you a different perspective , i have medium sized mom-hands and the bags feel snug. -- the bags , as i mentioned are smallish . however they are easy to tie off at the top ... at least for the poops my dogs produce. -- it 's a little difficult to tear off bags from the roll. -- and it 's a tad difficult to get the bags open at the top. -- the bags are strong , with sufficient thickness..overall , i like them . mine had virtually no smell , and they are easy to carry in a pocket .

> they 're playing our song is one of the more delighful musicals penned during the 'wilderness years ' of the late-70 's . it starred lucie arnaz and robert klein as two unlucky-in-love song writers who end up falling in love with each other.the score , by carole bayer sager with music by marvin hamlisch ( a chorus line ) bridges the gap between pop and traditional broadway music , and includes the numbers & quot ; fallin ' & quot ; , & quot ; if he really knew me & quot ; , & quot ; right & quot ; and the title song.lucie arnaz spins gold with all her numbers but is most charming in & quot ; just for tonight & quot ; and the 11 o'clock number & quot ; i still believe in love & quot ; .this musical played a sell-out broadway season before being mounted in london as well as in australia , with the latter production starring jacki weaver .

> yes , george lucas has made the same kind of alterations to his visionary first film as he did to his star wars trilogy , however the changes made to thx 1138 have not taken away the punch that it has always packed . lucas ' vision of a dystopian future is still as unsettling as it has always been , and the newly remastered sound make every blip and sound effect better than ever . those fans who have given a distinctive groan over hearing of new effects added to the film should give it a chance , although there will be plenty of jaded fans who may be better off sticking to their old video tape . if you have never seen this film and only know lucas by his star wars cash cows , then i strongly suggest checking this out , just do n't go in expecting a story from a galaxy far , far away .

> hayao miyazaki has made so many wonderful films that it 's difficult to pick one out as his best . however , this film certainly belongs on a very short list of the best animated films of all time . sisters satsuki and mei move to an old country home with their father , unaware that they have moved into close proximity with an array of magical creatures who are connected to nature . this is the perfect family film . there are no villains , no fights , no scary monsters , yet there is great drama in the sense of discovery that the sisters experience as they learn more about this secret world that exists just next door . miyazaki 's portrait of a world full of benevolent mystery is very moving . buy it . you wo n't regret it .

> okay , you have to buy this ! it 's such a great way to teach a child about lying , but making it in such a way that they do n't forget it . just telling a child not to lie sometimes does n't quite drive the message home , but larryboy sure does ! the only thing that might be slightly objectionable here is when the huge space alien lie tries to eat larry and is actually in his mouth . my little guy got upset about that part because he loves larry . other than that , we laughed ourselves silly ! i got this because my child decided to tell a lie and i wanted to make sure he actually understood what could happen when lies are told.thanks to veggietales for making a great lesson so much more interesting and unforgettable . we now have a larrymobile , complete with suction cup ears , and archibald and larryboy . great toy ! so , if you want to laugh until you cry while teaching a very important lesson , grab this one . it 's just nothing short of awesome ! just beware , i 'm now going around most of the day talking like archibald and being asked such questions as `` what are you going to make the larrymobile do now , archibald ? what are you inventing ? can i help ? '' it gets difficult trying to imitate all those voices all day ! sure is a bunch of fun ! now the larrymobile has a pizza machine on it so larryboy wo n't get hungry saving bumblyburg , and also a bed so that he can take a nap when he 's tired . the imagination just never stops with these videos !

> my review title comes from carlotta lanier 's prologue . her gift for story-telling and at times both gut-wretching and heart-pounding experiences at central high belong in my american history library.the first four chapters are a memoir of her family and her childhood in arkansas and that pivotal summer in new york -- 1951 -- and the lingering presence of segregation and `` whites only '' transit programs . she grew up around strong and loving family members who all supported her educational goals.suspense builds up in chapter five , `` d-day , '' continues on into the next chapter , `` the blessing of walls . '' getting into the school was , as we learn , only half the battle . the other battle was overcoming the constant taunts by the students around her , taunts that were ignored by teachers and the armed guards sent to protect her entry into the school.to carlotta 's credit , she does n't write with hate . she has every reason to hate the people that made her teenage years at central a hell ( as she puts it ) . this hate-free story is what makes this all the more compelling to anyone who picks this book up . carlotta sticks to her memory and the facts of the day . she did a lot of research to produce this work of oral history in print . it 's a fine collection for anyone interested in american history , black studies , women , americans .

> so i decided a few months back that i wanted to get rid of cable at my house and just stream netflix and hulu plus , but was worried about local channels . i did some research online and it led me to this product . i always look and read the reviews of others before purchasing anything , so i was surprised to see all the rave reviews . just last week i decided to order one of these and see if all the rave reviews were in fact true . i can say without a doubt that this product is amazing ! when i received it , i immediately connected it to my tv and hung it high on the wall temporarily with a thumbtack to see if i would get any channels . my tv started searching and was shocked to see that i get 14 channels . i get all the local channels and i even think that the image from most of them are clearer than those i get from directv . so in short , i will be ordering another one for my basement to see just how well it works down there and if it does n't , i always could find another home for it . needless to say that if you are looking for something that 's thin , does n't take up a lot of space , and does n't require any power source , you have found the right product !

> friday night lights gives a good picture of small-town texas where high school football is the most exciting thing around . the whole town feels ownership in the team , and people do n't hesitate to tell the coaches what to do , and the players , how to do it . the end result , especially in a town like odessa , where past successes fuel future aspirations , is a coach and players who are in a constant pressure-cooker . the movie illustrates the different reactions which individuals have to these pressures . billy bob thorton , as the coach , is unfailingly polite to the townspeople , even when they track him down outside of wal-mart to give him advice . he cares more about the boys ' character than how many games they win , an attitude which is not always popular in odessa . his star player is a cocky young man who puts all of his hopes on obtaining a college scholarship and eventually playing in the pros . when an injury ends this dream , he is shattered . the quarterback is sincere and hard-working and loves football , but he hates the pressure of winning . another of the young players is constantly harrassed by his father who won a state championship and will stand for nothing less from his son . this is an exciting sports movie which clearly demonstrates the problems with the `` win at all costs '' mentality .

> this is n't quite as good as laura hillenbrand 's first book , seabiscuit , but still a good read . it shows how strong someone can be in the face of adversity . the book is a little slow starting , as there is a lot of background at the beginning , leading up to the real story , which is not unlike seabiscuit , in seabiscuit , it seemed to work better than in this book , as you are always waiting for the real story to begin . this does present a horrifying picture of how the japanese treated some prisoners of war . we often hear about the nazi atrocities , but the japanese were also very cruel to prisoners . they even executed large numbers of prisoners , not unlike what happened in germany . it 's an important book because it gives you glimpses into what the war was like somewhat from the japanese perspective and demonstrates that any culture can be cruel and do terrible things in a war situation . i hope that hillenbrand writes more good books , but with her serious health issues , it is an uphill battle for her to do so . after seabiscuit , according to her , she was n't sure she would find another subject that she really was passionate enough to write about , until she came across this story .

> this movie was surprisingly good as compared to the preconceived notion i had prior to watching it , and it is a movie the entire family can enjoy : i would have given it a 4 star rating but the other three members of my family gave it 5 stars.matt damon delivers as a father struggling with raising two children by himself , scarlett johansson actually does a good bit of acting in this one vs. just looking good for the camera ( which she does with no problem ) , and the two children might be our next generation of child stars . i thought the first 15 minutes or so of the movie started off slow , but the opening scenes are necessary to set the stage for the remainder of the story and it all comes together . if you 're looking for a good movie the entire family can sit around and enjoy , you might give this one a shot .

> ca n't help but evoke a comparison to yogi as he associates with a forest ranger and has a penchant for people food . overall a funny animated movie , but not a blockbuster like `` finding nemo '' . however , certainly worth a rental . if you enjoy animated movies like `` madgascar '' , you may find it worth purchasing . family friendly with about the worse being the stag putting the bears backpack with cookies in front of his crotch , thus making the bear refuse to eat them . the whole forest pretty much get 's into this one when a rangers pet bear , `` boog '' , finds himself in the forest with no buddies . in a short amount of time he has everyone allied and assaulting the hunters as hunting season opens . remember , `` the odd will get even '' . the dvd quality is good and contains a few extras .

> i totally love being sucked into gideon and eva 's world . these 2 tortured souls have so much baggage and issues to deal with so it 's even more gratifying as they keep figuring out how to deal together . sylvia day did a great job moving this journey forward as eva copes with issues from her past and how these impact her future with gideon . i can see why there will be more books because there are still so many items to resolve especially for gideon that hasn't/could n't happen with the other things going on . i love how we see cary , megumi , mark , etc become more important parts of eva ' life and how these relationships help to shape/make her stronger with gideon . if you liked the first 2 books , i think you will totally enjoy book 3 and will be anxious for more when you are finished ! enjoy ! !

> wow an amazing story ! really a good book , shows how tough our seals are ! starts out first half of the book with mainly the training and life before the famous incident . then the second half is the battle that many brave seals lost their lives , and the eventual rescue of marcus lutrell.the training of the seal is very interesting . i have read rogue warrior and chris kyle 's book this is definitely just as well written.the other seals in the book are so well written it makes it very heartbreaking to learn their fates . one of the seals has a park dedicated to his memory where i live in colorado . i recommend this book highly and if you ca n't put it down and lose sleep like i did you also might want to read the books i mentioned above .
= lone survivor story of seal marcus lutrell ... great read !

> my second grader is starting to learn multiplication tables in school , and the multiplication wrap-ups are dynamite . simply dynamite . they are useful to help him `` noodle out '' the correct answer from the answers given , and it is so encouraging for him to flip it over to see if he got them right . he plays with this constantly in the car -- he likes to teach his pre-school age brother , too -- a captive audience . there 's no frustration -- if he messes up , he just unwinds and tries again.perfect for a more hands-on learner , like my little boy -- much more fun than flashcards.i 've ordered division and fractions for him to play with on our summer vacation .
= awesome -- much more fun than flashcards
< dynamite

> the lord of the rings movies have the perfect combination of emotional acting , fantastical scenery , and thrilling plot twists . peter jackson and his team did a superb job and deserved every single oscar they got . and of course the soundtrack - howard shore 's soundtrack will probably go down in history as the best movie soundtrack ever . the movies are a wonderful tribute to the books . fortunately , they 've been made so well that they can be enjoyed by all , from the tolkien aficionado to kids who have n't yet read the books . if you have n't seen this movie , you have n't seen the greatest adventure in cinematography during the past decade .

> been using my pair for 2 years now . they are durable and quite comfortable . what i love about new balance is that they are available in many widths , mine is 4e . it is almost impossible for me to find a pair in shopping malls . this one fits perfectly . i think the price is not too steep compared to other brands.it is my everyday shoes for work and recreation . it is described as walking shoes but i also use it for some light jogging & tennis . nice minimalistic simple design . leather is supple ... and yes , the biggest reason i bought it is velcro .
= nice comfortable pair ... velcro

> the boy who got in the car seems to be the theme of the novel.three boys grow up into men of very different typesand meet again due to a horrible murder of the bad one 's beautiful daughter.at the very start of this novel a comment about the boys developing a hate for chocolate candy due to their father 's jobs rang false to me.there is an amoral type slant to this novelthat bothers me.there is the systematic assumption that the `` broken '' boy ca n't be fixed and will be a problem always ... i think maybe that just accepting that assumption has flawed this novel ?

< not free sf reader

> the bottom line : a movie unlike any you 've seen , with several of its most fascinating shots alone being worth the price of admission -- no cgi was used in the film -- and with a fascinating story to boot , the fall was easily one of the best movies of 2008 , even if the academy thought otherwise ; it 's not a perfect film , but its memory and images will linger in your mind far longer than scenes from the reader or milk will.3.5/4

> i only just started using this coffeemaker , but so far everything is going well with it . it works great , and i have n't experienced the odor issues other reviewers have noted . the coffeemaker also has several great features , including an automatic cleaning cycle , which is awesome . for a $ 50-something coffeemaker , i really do n't expect this to last more than a year or two , but you get a lot of great features for the price .

> if you carry a firearm on a regular basis , you know that there are a number of places in every state where you 're not allowed to carry , like post offices and other federal buildings . there are also places you may not wish to carry . in any event , it 's useful to have a secure lockbox in your car where you can safely store a firearm . travelers carrying a pistol cross country need a way to store it in adherence with federal law when traveling through states that are hostile to individual firearm ownership , or when staying in a hotel room . recreational and target shooters will find this case useful as well , for transport to and from the local range.i 've been using an inexpensive nanovault case for car storage , and while it 's relatively inexpensive ( under $ 30 ) , it 's not terribly secure , and it 's not terribly roomy . this case is an improvement in every way . it 's larger , much more rugged , it has a more solid locking system , a thicker anchoring cable , and something that should be obvious for a travel safe- a handle ! it 's also nicely padded , with foam layers top and bottom . and it has a serial number that allows you to get a replacement key from sentry if need be . and it 's not just for guns . travelers might find it useful for storing jewelry or excess cash . it could also be used it for transporting valuables to and from a bank safe deposit box.for home storage it 's best to have either a heavy safe or a solid lock box that can be bolted to the floor or a wall , but for travel this is a great solution .

> tris ' world has crumbled for various reasons . now she has the opportunity to go outside the city 's boundaries to discover what 's beyond . however , what tris and her friends discover may be something that is totally unexpected.my straightforward opinion of the final book was that it was the worst in the series . this series seemed to go downhill as the story went on . i only read this book because i really wanted to know how the trilogy ends . first of all i did not like the alternating point of views . sometimes it makes the story better and sometimes it makes it more confusing . in this case it made the story more confusing . second , i did not like tobias in this book at all . he is a totally different person . in the first and second book there is great character development and then in the final book he is really different . third , tris and tobias ' relationship seems to be one of the main problems in the book . they do n't seem to trust each other about anything and most of the time they are arguing . lastly , it was very depressing . *spoiler* i was crying while reading the last few chapters that were from tobias ' pov . i have never read a book in which the author has the main character killed . i mean seriously . the last few chapters were basically about how much tobias missed tris and how he was dealing with the situation.so my message to all of you who are reading this review is ... do not read allegiant ! you will be greatly disappointed .
= allegiant
< the worst in the series

> literary taste can be subjective , subject to the interests , background , and preferences of the reader . this is why prospective readers should read more than one review of a book.the beach street knitting society and yarn club is just not my cup of tea . i could n't get into the characters or the story or the `` so-called '' romance . it 's one of those books that compels me to incessantly look ahead to see how many pages are left.it 's definitely a british book , and though i understood most of the colloquialisms , a few got by me . the knitting angle is a hook to motivate those with a knitting interest to read this book , but i do n't think that works either . i asked my wife to read this book also since she has been known to twirl the knitting needles from time to time . she read the first hundred pages and begged off , saying she could n't take any more . this is a woman who reads voraciously.jo 's two young boys are said to be `` rowdy , energetic boys . '' those out of control hooligans irritated me to no end as did the lack of discipline and control on the part of their mom.finally , what irks me the most about this book is the excessive dialogue to advance the plot . it can drone on and on for pages before it mercifully ends . as far as the dialogue goes , i think it may improve the book if the author could crimp it .
= some knit picking
< not my cup of tea

> mysterious skin ( gregg araki , 2004 ) a good deal of my problem with hollywood can be summed up by one unfortunate set of scenes in gregg araki 's adaptation of scott heim 's intriguing novel mysterious skin . all of these scenes concern brian ( thirteen 's brady corbet ) 's relationship with avalyn friesen ( mary lynn rajskub of 24 ) . every time she appeared on the screen , i could n't help but think `` this is the conception of ` grossly overweight ' [ as she 's described in the book ] in california ? '' that alone was enough to throw off my enjoyment of the film ; the feeling was exacerbated by a number of small changes , the kind of thing i 'd normally assume was done to preserve the film 's r rating , but with more involved in each case . ( for example , the lovely scene in the novel where neal ( joseph gordon-levitt ) , his mother ( elisabeth shue ) , and eric ( jeff licon ) go picnicking the day before neal leaves for new york is torn to shreds ; the portion of it that might have messed with the film 's rating is there , in abbreviated , almost prudish , form , but all the rest of the scene has been dispensed with . ) not a terrible movie , but do yourself a favor : see it before you read the book , so you do n't know what you 're missing until afterwards . **
= decent film , but bad adaptation .
< good deal , but not a terrible movie .

> i love the message of love in this book . i love this boys description of heaven as a place with rainbows . i do not doubt that to this boy and his family feel his experience was real . i do not doubt that he had some kind of after life experience or even that he went to heaven . however his father is a christian pastor and i do not doubt that this played a big role in his interpretation of what happen . the fact that the information was collected by his father , the pastor , makes it even less measurable . if the information had been collected from the boy by an outside even neutral party then i would consider it valid . the father describes himself preparing for his sermons at home while the children play around him . the family is deeply religious and live a very church based life . of course the boy absorbed all this even by four years old . children absorb everything . and of course this tainted his interpretation of what happen and what he saw . i also have to question why the fact that the boy saw the virgin mary in heaven was saved until the epilog . again tainted by their faith . if they were catholics this would have been on the front cover ! i am a catholic . i believe in jesus , mary and angels . however , this story was tainted .
= sorry tainted story
< i love the message of love in this book

> ... i suppose . that reader might be a middle-schooler reading way ahead of grade level . i have a hard time calling this ya because of the relatively tame adventure , cartoony violence ( what little there is ) , very cartoony characters , and complete lack of romantic interest . and dinosaurs . and the illustrations - pen drawing textured like edward gorey 's , but without all the things that made his style so memorable . but , at 400+ pages and with a fairly broad vocabulary , this is hardly one for a small child to approach unaided . ( maybe the harry potter reading level - not that this is anything like that series . ) but a serious bookworm ( of which i 'm one ) will get at least a grin from a world where everything in centered on books : all commerce ( at least what 's mentioned ) , relationships , adventures , characters , underground civilizations ( and some not so civil ) , the prison fare when our hero is held captive by the not-so-bad-in-the-end bad guy , and even nsbite bad guy himself . then , there 's the grand achievement at the end of the quest : becoming the greatest writer who ever lived.somewhat amusing , i found it tedious in places and ultimately not memorable . at least , i hope i do n't spend too much time thinking about it in the future. -- wiredweird

> this is a really fun game great for a game night when you have kids of all ages . the directions are very , very simple and take a quick 2 minutes to read . from then , it is easy to play and the strategy can easily be taught to little or big ones.what 's really neat is that anyone can win - there is a very nice 'chance ' factor in the form of the egg - eggs do n't roll straight due to their shape so there 's no guarantee your egg will roll where you want it to . as often as not , we hit our own hens and not just our opponents.the game takes about 8 minutes to play out - a bit faster with 2 people and a bit longer with four people . of course , it 's more fun with 4 people since there are more hens to chuck the egg at.my 6 year old loves it - she even loves saying the name . when we are n't playing it , she practices chucking the egg on waiting pieces.i like the 3d feel to this and the way it is laid out . an easy to play game and fun for everyone .

> with the case , i do n't have to be so darn careful handling the kindle fire . that makes me feel good . at the same time i 'm not confident it will hold up that long.the weakness in the case is clear to me . it has to do with the way the unit attaches to the case . the corner bands hold the device , yet the bands are stretched tight with each held by a thread on 4 stitches . if just one stitch on one band goes bad , it could easily cause the case to fail at holding the kindle fast.in my view , a better case would have as its strongest points the connectors that actually hold the device as well as a minimal barrier against damage . this case has the outside material glued to cardboard , making it bulkier than i prefer .

> there is a jewish saying that ' a very small container ' can not truly measure a much greater one . this is the way i feel when saying a few words about ' the new history of the world ' by j.m.roberts . it is work which developed from years of study , understanding of a tremendous number of different fields and periods . much of what is written about here i simply do not have the ' container ' to measure . i do know this is a valiant effort . i can not affirm that it is the base one- volume history of the world as many claim . i do know that it contains a tremendous amount of historical judgment which can challenge the readers to developing understanding of their own on the matter .

> despite the book 's success , and its many rave reviews , i really did not enjoy it . i expected a humorous memoir , but i did not laugh out loud even once . more than anything , this was a shocking , disturbing , disgusting at times horrifying read . i read burrough'smagical thinking : true stories , and had enjoyed that , but this book did not share any of the lightness or humour . it bordered on hard to believe that any of this could really happen , and mostly just felt sad . it was not a pleasure to read , but it was oddly compelling . it had the same negative attraction as not speeding past an accident .

> not only is she a beautiful and talented actress , but krisitn chenoweth is an amazing singer . i knew that chenoweth had performed on broadway and originated the role of glenda in wicked , but was unaware that she had already released several solo albums . therefore , when i learned that she had released a christmas album , i picked it up just in time for the christmas season . the album is mostly a mix of classic christmas songs with a few newer tunes as well as some very interesting variations.my favorites on the album include : '' i 'll be home for christmas '' -- a beautiful rendition of the christmas standard . `` do you hear what i hear ? '' -- an uplifting version of one of my favorite christmas carols . `` sing '' -- yes , it 's a song from sesame street , but it fits with the rest of the music on this album and is actually my 2nd favorite song on the album . `` come on ring those bells '' -- a country christmas carol that tells the real meaning of christmas . `` born on christmas day '' -- i had never heard this song before , but really enjoyed the lyrics and the song was even more powerful being sung by kristin . `` sleep well little children/what a wonderful world '' -- this song is my favorite on the album . it 's a beautiful song that makes a great epilogue to the album.overall , this is a beautifully sung christmas album that i enjoyed listening to very much . it was playing at our house all during the christmas season . highly recommended for fans of kristin chenoweth and anyone who enjoys excellent christmas music .

> i purchased the $ 99 kindle touch e-reader and really did want to like it . it arrived on 11/28 and today , 12/04 , i 'm ready to return it . i have the kindle keyboard 3g but like the idea of a touch screen and the virtual keyboard so what would there be not to like about the touch ? pros , imo:1- nice and light , oz lighter than the kkb2- easy to hold in one hand3- good screen that 's as easy to read in normal light as the kkb4- swipe up and advance to the next chapter , swipe down and go to the previous chapter5- i forgot to mention being able to touch a word to bring up the dictionary . darn i liked that conceptcons , imo:1- extremely sensitive touch , it 's too easy to accidentally advance 2 or more pages , which i 've done many times2- the screen is recessed from the bezel too much , much further than either the kkb or the kindle fire . this makes the keyboard a little awkward to use3- it has only the portrait orientation for pdf documents . yes it 's possible to enlarge/expand the text but the screen needs to refresh with each motion which makes the whole process aggravating , therefore useless , imo . the kkb allows for landscape orientation , 4 options for size plus a `` nudge '' function which is not as jerky as the kt.i 've listed only 3 `` cons '' but these are enough for me . now i 'll wait to see if there 'll be a 7 '' kindle e-ink touch device with both portrait and landscape orientation . that could very well be the cat 's meow .

> several years ago in england , king henry ii accused and executed several lords including the father of eighteen year old isabel de lamere for rebellion against the throne . everything the nobles owned became forfeited to the crown , which meant that isabel and her younger sister were now illegitimate . their humiliated mother returned to france until word reached isabel that she died.in 1189 king richard realizes that isabel has inherited an estate in france and decides the heiress must marry an aristocrat of his choice . his highness chooses the earl of montborne . in spite of not trusting males , perhaps since griffin of droghallow saved her life a decade ago , isabel sees sebastian montborne as the only hope for her much younger sibling so she agrees to wed him . however , as she travels to her wedding , her childhood hero griffin kidnaps her and a companion , killing their escorts . someone is willing to pay a bounty to insure isabel does not marry sebastian . when griffin fails to receive his booty , he refuses to hand over his prisoner to his foster brother . as he awaits payment , griffin and isabel fall into a forbidden love.white lion 's lady is an exciting medieval romance starring two strong lead characters whose love appears worthless due to the intrigue swirling every where in aristocratic england . the story line is fastthough it remains inside sub-genre guidelines . the cast makes the tale as readers will empathize with isabel and even griffin the kidnapper while hissing at several other players . tina st. johns has written an enticing twelfth century tale of star-crossed lovers that sub-genre readers will fully delight in their tale.harriet klausner

> the shining is one of the scariest books i ever read . it caused me many a sleepless night . unfortunately , although this is danny , the scares just are n't there . mr. king mentions , at the end of the book , that people have changed , as has he , since the original work . i actually felt like he had taken some sort of bet about being able to make anything scary . unfortunately this subject , rv travelers , was never scary , and he was unable to make it so . in this book he trades the terror of the overlook hotel for a band of traveling oldsters . of course , they are not what they seem , but they are also never terrifying . i read the book in a little over a day . mr. king 's writing style is still superb and he makes an excellent book , but this one falls short of even the lowest expectations . i believe that another factor that diminishes any scares is that the little girl in the book is too strong and you are never really afraid for her . unlike the helpless and vulnerable danny , she is almost godlike in power so you never develop the type of worry for her you had for danny . i had high hopes for this book and though i 'm sure mr. king did not want to simply redo the scares of his original , i believe he may have been better off , and better served his readers , by doing so .
= not a scare in the entire book .

> i did n't hate this book and i certainly do n't want to sound like i am degrading the author or her work in any way . i went into this thinking i was getting a simple romance/love story and after reading the blurb for the book was n't really expecting it to be what it was . i found the repeated use of foul language in this book to be unnecessary , in fact , sometimes it almost seemed like it was added as an afterthought as it did n't fit the story . the sex scenes in this book were not to my personal taste . i always find that i can appreciate them when they add to the character 's romance , but these ones just seemed like they were cut and pasted out of a harlequin blaze.there were some interesting parts of this story , and i really felt the author did a good job on her character building with nathan . he seemed realistic and his thoughts and emotions were a good match for the role he played in the story . most of the dialogue ( other than aforementioned swearing ) in this book was pretty good . i think if this book was edited to remove some of the profanity it would have been a worthy of a much higher star rating . as it is though , i just do n't get why it was important to add those elements and truly felt the book would have been better without them .

> a woman ( deborah harry from videodrome ) is busy preparing for her roasted paperboy dinner . said paperboy ( matthew lawrence ) comes up w/ a plan to forestall his grisly fate by telling the crazed cook some stories . in lot 249 , a college nerd ( fargo 's steve buscemi ) uses an ancient mummy to exact vengeance on his idiot tormentors ( including hannibal 's julianne moore as well as a seemingly 12yo christian slater ) w/ surprising results . next , in the cat from hell , a zillionaire ( william hickey ) hires a hitman ( david johansen ) to terminate the family cat . johansen is great as the smug killer , overmatched by the ferocious feline . finally , we have lover 's vow , where an artist ( james rebar ) witnesses a murder-by-hideous-gargoyle one dark night . the creature spares his life , so long as he never tells a living soul about what he has seen . can our hero keep his trap shut , or will he blab ? this one features the breathtakingly-beautiful rae dawn chong ! tales from the darkside is one of the better horror anthology movies . it 's up there along side of creepshow , cat 's eye , ( the original ) tales from the crypt , twilight zone , and dr. terror 's house of horrors . darkside is certainly one of the more solid , consistent , and gory of the bunch ! ...

> i 'm always surprised by new products , sometimes pleasantly so . take band-aids , for example . have you noticed the variety available ? well , i found yet another . it 's called a band-aid water block plus . it 's a small band-aid , about 1 '' by 2/8 , '' and it 's stuck on a clear larger sticky strip . when you peel off the backing , you 're left with a two-part strip to cover the wound or blemish . first , there 's the little conventional band-aid patch and then there 's the sticky larger transparent strip . the band-aid part goes over the wound and the larger transparent part goes over the surrounding area . together , they form a water-resistant patch . how well it works depends on what kind of surface you apply it to . on a fairly flat or gently surface it can work quite well and keep water away from a wound much better than the conventional band-aid . also , i put one on a finger knuckle . the bending of the knuckle broke the water seal , yet the band-aid did a better job of staying on the knuckle than a conventional band-aid . the only trouble i had with it is that it rolls a bit around the edges as the water block patch ages . so , it 's not perfect , but has some advantages here and there.gary peterson

> mel gibson proved his mettle as a director with the epic , `` braveheart '' , the story of william wallace , the scottish warlord who united his countrymen against their british oppressors . the most striking elements here are the staging of the battle scenes and excellent cinematography . that said , if gibson had n't assembled a decent cast the technical attributes of the film would be meaningless . gibson does solid work here as wallace . naturally , villainy is more of a challenge as an actor and patrick mcgoohan as edward i ( longshanks ) is more than up to the task . after viewing this film i was compelled to research the historical accuracy of some of the events in the film . for instance , wallace and his men never sacked york . one of the film 's contrivances is a possible tryst between wallace and the princess of wales which is highly unlikely since she was about 10 years old at the time events in the film transpired . these issues are addressed , however , in gibson 's extremely engaging commentary on the dvd .

> this landmark november 1974 is equally a grand moment in the band 's career and what also seemed to be a high-octane coda.recorded in july and august , robert fripp disbanded the group in late-september , which meant the album was issued without an accompanying tour . though supplemented with a number of musicians - mel collins ( soprano sax ) , ian mcdonald ( alto sax ) , robin miller ( oboe ) , mark charig ( cornet ) , david cross ( violin ) - this is fripp 's venue , as he masterfully weaves guitar dubs throughout the compositions.the title track contains one of the greatest guitar solos from a recording studio , with fripp taking his playing to incredible heights . starless is arguably the finest track recorded by the group up to this point and remains a crowning achievement in a vast catalog of quality work.with john wetton ( bass , vocals ) and bill bruford ( drums , percussion ) delivering in wickedly wonderful fashion , the album defies time , while re-defining the power trio concept .

> i have owned many straighteners over the past 10 years . the number has to be around 15. i started buying off run of the mill , low quality ones from walmart . after watching my hair break off and become dry , i decided it was time to upgrade.the styler ceramic tourmaline ionic flat iron hair straightener is the third high quality straightner that i have owned and it lives up to the standard i was expecting.if you are looking for a styler that heats up fast and seals in moisture , look no further ! plus the swivel cord is a great touch . no more getting caught or tangling ! although i have given this 5 stars , i am a bit confused as to why the temperature control is in such odd spot . if it were up to me , i 'd move it . however , this seems to be a standard with many straighteners lately so i did not deduct any stars.the pouch is a great addition . no straightener i 've owned has ever offered one with the product for free and i wanted one . it 's great for traveling to make sure my investment is protected.i would also like to mention that if the one inch plate makes you shy away from ordering this , it 's a mistake . i thought bigger was better and never would have given a second thought to one so thin . trust me , you do n't need a flat iron bigger than an inch . this does an amazing job of making your hair completely straight without any hair getting caught and being pulled .

> the more dan brown i read , the more i enjoy dan brown . the man is a master of the fast paced thriller and it is fun to watch his growth from one book to another even if i did begin my acquaintanceship with his blockbuster & quot ; the davinci code. & quot ; brown 's books always start fast and & quot ; digital fortress & quot ; is no exception . ensei tankado dies in a seville plaza . he raises his hand , fingers outstretched . . . and dies . susan fletcher , a national security agency cryptographer is roused from her dreams first by a call from david becker , her university professor boyfriend who tells her he has to postpone their planned weekend romantic retreat in order to fly off to an unknown destination . seething and disappointed , her anger if interupted by a call from commander strathmore , her nsa boss asking - commanding - that she come in on this saturday to help on an emergency project.it seems tankado has launched an attack on nsa 's most secret computers.from that point on , brown takes you on a non-stop adventure - and it 's fun.brown 's characters are well rounded and do n't engage in super-heroics , though they do seem to catch more than their share of lucky breaks . but brown 's plotting carries you over those points so fast that you fail or simply do n't want to notice them.for the thriller fan , & quot ; digital fortress & quot ; is an exhilarating read.jerry

> i love the direction that the brothers nolan have taken the batman series . emphasizing character and story over visuals and pyrotechnics they have made works for the ages . for starters they have fleshed out the characters introduced in `` batman begins '' as well as introducing new ones . judging from the volume of reviews i 'm sure that more than a few focused on heath ledger 's interpretation of the joker which is understandable . i 'll weigh in by saying inspired and leave it at that . what puzzles me is that in all the hype for the film little is mentioned of aaron eckhart 's portrayal of harvey dent . discretion dictates that i not give too much away , not that there 's many out there that have n't seen `` the dark knight '' , but eckhart 's work here is of great complexity and in my mind equals if not surpasses ledger 's . i 'm reminded of `` batman returns '' where the ostensible heavy was scarecrow but the more interesting character was the mentor character played by liam neeson ( sorry , i forgot the character 's name ) . regardless , i did n't see `` the dark knight '' at the movies and now having waited with baited breath i was n't disappointed .

> odd , but what i remember most about this film is the guys stuffing cotton swabs up their nose ! if you 've seen the film , you know what i 'm talking about ! sometimes juvenile , sometimes stupid and sometimes very predictable ... ..but yet this was a fun movie that is charming at times , too . i did enjoy watching this.the humor is a little sleazy at times but the language was n't too bad . kelsey grammar plays a likable role in the navy comedy . most of his crew are somewhat stupid characters but i did laugh at the sonar man with the great hearing . lauren holly was okay as the female interest but rob schneider was just plain annoying and tended to overact . he 's either very funny or very stupid in his films . bruce dern , as always , was an effective `` bad guy . `` the story is a favorite of the film industry : a bunch of rag-tag misfits and rebels somehow outwit and outmaneuver the larger establishment experts with their high-tech machinery . no matter how improbable or ridiculous , hollywood will not stop that formula nonetheless , it 's decent lightweight entertainment with a nice , sentimental ending .

> `` breath , eyes , memory '' is the story of a young haitian girl , sophie , whose mother travels to new york when her daughter is very young , leaving sophie in the care of her tante atie . eventually sophie 's mother sends for her child , and the girl must travel to the united states to start a new life . i thought this book would focus on the struggles of a haitian girl adjusting to american society , but sophie 's real demons lay with her family 's tragic history , which unfolds bit by bit as the years go by . sophie ultimately breaks away from her mother but is unable to escape from the horrors of her past . she eventually returns to her home country in search of answers and redemption.i thoroughly enjoyed this book . the subject matter is difficult to read , but this book depicts a lifestyle that was a reality for so many haitian women . although sophie and her female relatives endure many tragedies throughout the course of this story , `` breath , eyes , memory '' also celebrates strong family ties and the power that comes with being a woman . this is truly an amazing book .

> i really enjoyed the first book in this seriesapocalypse z : the beginning of the end . told in epistolary format , with a series of blog and then journal entries , this first book allowed the reader to follow the thought processes of the main protagonist - an unnamed lawyer - as the world is taken over by the undead.book two `` apocalypse z : dark days '' is told from a mangled hodgepodge of first and third person points of view and never seems to hang coherently together.there are just too many unbelievable happenings that just ring a discordant tone over the whole tale , not counting the zombies themselves.i kept reading , hoping it would get better , and it never did . in fact , it had one of the worst endings ever . yes , this is a series and yes , i expected a cliffhanger but what i got was the black hole of the canary islands.it felt like the book was rushed and many vital pieces were left out . the plotline felt choppy . the characters felt one-dimensional . it 's too bad . i enjoyed book one very much .

> this is one of the best vegan cookbooks around . everything i 've made so far is incredibly easy . you can get home from work and have a delicious meal on the table in record time . unlike a lot of cookbooks , the ingredient lists are short . the amazing thing about this book is that the food does n't come across as `` simple , '' `` low fat , '' or `` fast '' -- but it is . it also includes recipes for the things you crave when trying to watch what you eat -- pasta , potatoes , hefty and filling meals . everything is super-adaptable and the portion sizes are very flexible.if you are looking to eat healthier or just get dinner on the table quickly , this is one of the best choices available . if you are looking to integrate more vegetables into your diet , this cookbook is also a great way to do that -- instead of just telling you to eat more , isa actually provides suggestions that will make veggies something that you ca n't wait to eat .

> i 'm an adult , who loved the first santa clause movie , but the second one was , to put it bluntly , quite simply awful . in trying to analyze what i did n't like about this flick , i decided i thought the script was rather poorly written , cutesy and lacked the spontaneity of the first film . also too many sappy scenes at the north pole , and way too many elves ! and what is up with the low budget reindeer ? ick.i also wanted to see more of judge , whose therapist character is rather funny . however , he kept getting interrupted by the tim 's character which was just annoying . i also felt the main character 's son 's delinquacy was rather out of character and not fully explored.small children might enjoy this film entertaining , but i thought it was just plain silly . this film would be vastly improved by a better script , and less reliance on flashy cgi , and of course , more judge .

> i highly anticipated the release of this film looking for something innovative , perhaps something more absorbing than previous films about john dillinger . i was a bit let down . johnny depp 's ethereal performance of dillinger is just outright uninteresting and totally lacks an enigmatic presence he may have been trying to bring to the character.on the other hand , christian bale 's performance as melvin purvis is far more interesting with his dedicated yet restrained approach to catching up with dillinger . there is a certain admiral element of subtle dignity that bale brings to this role . that is what i like about this film.speaking of subtlety and restrained dignity , stephen lang 's charles winstead plays a brief but pivotal role defining what law and order was intended to be bolstering bale 's performance as one of the special agents on melvin purvis ' team.public enemies is worth watching ; however it falls far short from its potential of exploring the real john dillinger .

> this is a great size for a bedroom , kitchen , or small room of any sort . the picture quality is remarkably good for an `` off brand '' . i have acoby ledtv1926 19-inch 720p led hdtvthat i bought last year that has been an excellent tv.one word of advice / caution . my original coby was near a vizio and the vizio remote would control the coby . this knowledge came in very handy when trying to program my direct tv remote to control both this coby tv and the direct tv box . none of the coby codes work but the vizio codes did the trick.great price and pretty darn good picture and sound quality . overall very impressed .

> thrilling book and for the first novel well done . lots of suspense and action . as with any book i read that i like i got thoroughly caught up in the story and read it non stop . if i had to do it over again i would have slowed a little to take in the specifics a little better but the author does a good job of keeping you up to speedwith events while not getting jammed or bogged down . the end felt like a let down at first then i realized there is another book on the way and i anxiously await my chance to read .

> isabel gillies , a somewhat semi-well-known actress from her appearances on `` law and order : special victims unit '' ( which i admit i 've never seen ) comes out of nowhere with this memoir on how her marriage fell apart . i read the inner-flap and was intruiged enough to pick this up.in `` happens every day : an all true story '' ( 261 pages ) , the author retells the story of how she and her husband , a professor of english , came to relocate from ny to oberlin college , about an hour from cleveland , ohio , in the middle of nowhere . after some apprehension , she comes to absolutely love the small-town college environment , only to see things slip away when her husband takes interest in another woman . at one point , gillies and the other woman meet up for a movie , and gillies is stunned when she asks her in the abstract how incomprehensible it would be for someone to leave two little children ( her own , of course ) , and the response is `` it happens every day '' . as in : get over it . quite a stunner , of course.that said , i do n't know what the point of the book really is . it 's a good read , but nothing revelatory . even more annoying , if that is the right word , is that in the epilogue ( one half of a page ) , gillies mentions that her husband ended up marrying the other woman , and they all get along fine now , and that she 's found `` the love of her life '' ( the last words of the book ) , without any further explanation . huh ?
= enjoyable reading , but not sure what the point of it is

> it only took the stone roses five years of lawsuits and general self-destructiveness to produce the only follow up album to their 1989 self-titled masterpiece . it has since become apparent that & quot ; second coming & quot ; is also their swan song . that said , though not as strong as the debut , it 's a pretty darn good album in its own right . the roses were never ones to shy away from extended tracks , and they start right off with the nine-minute epic & quot ; breaking into heaven , & quot ; which starts slowly with a bunch of sound effects and pays off handsomely . after that comes a selection of songs more sonically challenging and for the most part less danceable than the debut . other highlights include the beautifully melodic & quot ; ten story love song , & quot ; the equally pretty & quot ; your star will shine , & quot ; the rocking & quot ; how do you sleep , & quot ; and the hit single & quot ; love spreads , & quot ; which is the most dance floor ready of any of these tunes . the rest of the material fills in adequately , but the & quot ; hidden & quot ; tracks at the end are , for the most part , not worth the effort.overall , a strong successor to the stone roses ' excellent debut that also serves as their epitath .
= ( finally ) following up a masterpiece
< a pretty good debut

> this sprawling epic adaption of the anne rice classic may suffer from some slow pacing and direction , but the absolutely awesome performances from tom cruise and brad pitt make interview with the vampire a much better film than it could have been . cruise is simply magnificent as lestat , the vampire who bites the grieving louis ( pitt ) , and thus begins lestat 's formation of an immortal family . cruise shines like no one ( not even rice herself ) could have imagined as lestat . stuart townshend has nothing on cruise as lestat as he carries the dark and seductive vampire trademark of the vampire , and this remains one of the best performances of his career . brad pitt 's portrayal of louis conveys all the remorse and melancholy that goes along with anyone stricken with immortal bloodlust . the rest of the cast includes a young kirstin dunst , antonio banderas , stephen rea , and christian slater ( in a role originally planned for river phoenix , slater replaced him after his untimely death ) , all of whom give great performances . all in all , interview with the vampire is one of the finest horror films of the 90 's , and the final shot of the film leading into guns 'n roses covering the rolling stones ' `` sympathy for the devil '' while the credits are rolling is reason enough to give this a look .
= cliche as it sounds , this film is simply awesome
< a epic adaption of the anne rice classic

> 1965 's `` the ipcress file '' is an extremely well executed dramatization of len deighton 's excellent spy novel of the same name . in one of his earlier roles , michael caine stars as british secret agent harry palmer , working class spy but smarter and tougher than he looks.palmer is assigned to a mysterious case in which top british scientists disappear for a few days , then reappear having been brainwashed to uselessness . the only clue is a fragment of recording tape with the word `` ipcress . '' whoever is kidnapping the scientists is prepared to kill to protect the process , as palmer 's colleagues discover . when palmer gets too close to the secret , he too is kidnapped . palmer will struggle for his freedom and his very sanity to complete his mission.the movie borrows the crisp , snappy dialogue of the original novel , while michael caine nicely captures harry palmer 's working class , anti-james bond personna . while the plotline is perhaps deliberately opaque , the direction is crisp and the movie uses a variety of intriguing shooting angles to add to the suspense , which builds nicely to a surprise ending.this movie is highly recommended to fans of michael caine and of len deighton , who will find this a dated but still very enjoyable film .
= palmer , harry palmer ...

> in this 1959 film bat masterson states at the very outset that he is reluctant to engage in a gunfight and kill people ; but despite his good intentions , he is drawn into several fights . an army sergeant is in love with a girl who happens to mention masterson , and provokes the sergeant 's jealousy . the sergeant tries to kill masterson , but masterson kills him instead . now both the sergeant 's brother and the sergeant 's army buddies are out to get him.masterson goes to dodge city where his brother is running against the incumbent sheriff who is aligned with outlaws . masterson buys a share in a saloon . the sergeant 's brother comes to dodge city and kills masterson 's brother in revenge , but masterson thinks that the renegade sheriff was the murderer . masterson runs for sheriff and needs to find a way to rid the town of the rowdies . two women vie for his affection . there is an attempted rape of one of the women . he is drawn into helping a retarded boy who was found guilty of murder and is scheduled to be hung . all in all , the film keeps the viewer 's interest and is very good for a 1959 western .

> the title explicitly says cisco , and indeed there is a lot of material enclosed that is specific to how cisco implements its wireless routers . but you could plausibly also use this book as a good guideline to general purpose wireless security.the authors have gone to some length to explain the general principles of 802.11* . in and of itself , this will be useful to some readers , for 802.11 is now a huge set of complex standards . with the official documentation being quite turgid prose , though necessary of course . for clarity , this book is a good and far more understandable alternative.the text also goes into associated topics , like the encryption protocols associated with 802.11. plus , and this is important , it describes third party , often open source , tools that can be used to sniff for insecure networks . tools like kismet or wellenreiter , where the latter is meant for wardriving . one of the first things you should do is download and use one of these tools [ or even several of them ] against your wireless net , if it is already running . better that you discover any weaknesses in it , than others do so .

> it is impossible to publish a collection of 30 stories by different thriller writers in which every story is a winner . that being said , i found over two-thirds of the stories to be interesting and well-written , but was happy to skim the clunkers . my clunkers will probably be some other readers ' favorites , however . i do n't like historical thrillers and found that i also do n't like historical thrillers in short-story form.my favorite stories were by david morrell , michael palmer , and mj rose . of those authors , i was encountering rose for the first time , but have read everything by morrell and palmer . brad thor is another author whom i 've never read before , but now will be tempted to try.i found james patterson 's introductions to be poorly written , and think that the next time a compilation like this is done , the writer of the intros should be someone who is still penning their own books , and not relying on ghostwriters and co-authors to get the job done.overall , this was an entertaining book , but to give it 5-stars means you loved every story . that 's highly unlikely .

> i got this 25 foot cable to connect my laptop to my flat screen tv . i needed the extra length so that i could run it around the edge of the room from the tv to the end table next to my easy chair where i sit when i watch tv . the length is just about right and both picture quality and sound quality are great . i watched a full length film with no flicker anywhere along the way . one thing to be aware of , the cable is quite thick and is a bit heavy and a little stiff . that can make it a little difficult to get it to completely unroll and lie straight . i suppose it 's because of shielding necessary to support the extended length and the newer standards.i also have a shorter , thinner , 6 foot cable which i can use to drive the tv from a laptop on the floor in front of it . i like that this longer cable lets me control everything from my comfortable chair across the room with no loss in sound or image quality .

> i wo n't quote his review , but wiki cites the key sentences , so i refer you to that . of course , it was a considerable financial success measured by box office take as compared to cost of production . i refer you to any of the five star reviews to explain why . to the average viewer , over the adolescent age of clutching companions while screaming `` gross '' , i would recommend seeing a film , watching which will not cause a bad accident with the popcorn you are eating . ( the last is a restatement of ebert 's advice ) . on the let 's be serious side , this is not what one would call a professionally made movie ; it is bunch of youngsters , say about the age of mickey and judy when they made the andy hardy one in which the kids get together to make a movie , just using themselves and other kids ... . but this time , without a script , just playing it by ear .

> i had very high hopes for this album after reading some early glowing reviews . in the end , i like most of it , but not nearly as much as i had hoped . it 's certainly not a classic of any sort , but there are flashes of greatness on this cd ; lyrical fragments and melodic choruses that are quite delightful.listening to this cd , you ca n't ignore the very retro vibe . which is fine by me . some of these songs remind me of great artists such as t.rex , the kinks , david bowie , and even 10cc . and yet , despite such excellent influences , or reference points , the songs do n't quite rise to the level of true greatness . again , this is not a bad album , it 's just not earth shattering . maybe i & # 34 ; m jaded , but i 've heard it all before . but there is enough promise and spirited energy displayed on this album that i 'll be curious to hear the next effort by this band . it sounds like they might be capable of making something really special next time around .

> this book got mixed reviews in our household . young ( 10 and under ) thought it was hilarious . presented as the blog of a 7th grader , these humorous paragraphs are just the right length to allow young readers to read for five minutes or ten or whatever , and the material is funny enough -- the musings of a 12-year old seinfeld-ish kid . those who like diary of a wimpy kid may like this . however , the older kids ( 12 and up ) , thought it was condescending and tried too hard , with daily mood designations ( thoughtful , puzzled , depressed ) and ( my translation ) lack of narrative . rather than seeming to be written by a 12-year old boy , it seems more like `` it 's written by a sixteen-year old girl '' .tad is a nice kid in an intact family with a little sister who 's gifted and friends who are just as clueless as he is , wondering about technology and movies and life . i enjoyed it more than the older kids did , but not as much as the younger ones .

> eric burdon and the animals were one of the bands that had a heavy impact on the london rnb and rock scene , and this collection does a fair job of crediting them . but it makes a big boner of a mistake by putting in an alternate version of `` we got ta get out of this place . '' ah well.but if you want the cool songs `` house of the rising sun '' and `` do n't let me be misunderstood , '' they are both here . missing is `` sky pilot '' or any material from later albums likebefore we were so rudely interruptedor the 80 's reunionark . the bulk of the album covers the songs mickie most brought to the group in 64-66 , and before alan price ( he who created the incredible organ riff on `` house of the riding sun '' ) left the group . as such , it has a lot of the band 's covers and is a worthy set . too much is missing to make it invaluable .

> all these are very watchable , but come from vastly different genres . orphan black started slow , but i was binge watching very quickly . waitress is not a chick flick do much as a movie told and directed by a woman about women 's lives . it deals with issues that chick flicks never recognize , much les approach . escape is interesting if you know nothing about the mormon religion , but the writing is pedestrian . on the other hand , get shorty , based on an elmore leonard book , is snappy and a classic , but it just did not appeal to me as some of his other work has , such as justified , based on fire in the hole . i hate you , do n't leave me is an entire update of the classic from the late 1980s . if you have any interest in someone with borderline personality disorder , read this book ! ! ! ! ! !

> this is a terrific mouse . it is stylish , comfortable and wireless . the nano receiver is low profile . just plug it in and you are good to go . it operates smoothly and is exceedingly comfortable to use . it is also ambidextorous so both lefties and righties will be able to use it with ease . the color is more of a metallic turquoise than an indigo . there is a pretty silver and true indigo design adding some elan . it comes with the required battery.i especially appreciated the easy open package . popping open those hard plastic clamshells can be a lnightmare but this one has easy open tabs on the back.a mouse is a small thing in the general scheme of things . but the superior performance , comfort , attractive appearance and caring touches of this one enhance the computing experience and just make life easier .

> phone booth has gotten mixed reviews , ... but ... , i really liked it . yeah , it could have been cut , with perhaps the saved time being used to develop further the relationship with the mistress [ hopeful ] and with the wife . but still . i was on the edge of my seat each time that creepy voice on the other end of the line chuckled and commanded the poor guy to reach for the gun overhead . although the tension was high , the end was predictable - but if for nothing else , the movie is worth watching just for the scenes with the hookers who want that guy out of the phone booth.four stars .

> terry bradshaw and kathy bates play the parents of matthew mcconaughey , a 35-year-old who still lives at home . in an effort to get him out of the house they hire sarah jessica parker , an `` interventionist '' who has been successful at helping other young men become independent by acting as if she is interested in them romantically . things get complicated when , inevitably , mcconaughey and parker become truly attracted to each other and the ruse suddenly becomes a betrayal . the movie alternates between total cliches and a few nice moments . the cast is good and zooey deschanel deserves special mention as parker 's quirky roommate . this movie provides a pleasant evening 's entertainment .

> this is the brilliant solo album from serj and it is outstanding . it has his usual cutting , intelligent lyrics , backed up by some amazing music . this is all the more impressive as it is written , engineered , produced and mainly played all by serj . all the tracks are great and get better with repeated listening , although 'empty walls ' and 'honking antelope ' are particular favourites for me . if you like soad you 'll like this , simple as that . a top effort from serj and so good to have him back in my music listening life ! feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> wilkie collins ' & # 34 ; the moonstone & # 34 ; , first published in 1868 and set in 1848 , will be instantly recognizable to fans of & # 34 ; csi & # 34 ; and other television crime shows , as a fairly modern detective story , complete with a cursed diamond , a closed-house english mystery with many suspects , conspiracies , star-crossed lovers , and one or more dogged detectives. & # 34 ; the moonstone & # 34 ; begins with the theft of a revered religious object , a large yellow diamond known as the moonstone , from a temple in india . the diamond ends up , probably by foul means , in the hands of a british officer , who becomes an outcast from his own family for his suspected crime . when the officer leaves the moonstone to his niece rachel , through the good offices of his nephew franklin blake , a chain of events is triggered that will lead to the disappearence of the moonstone , an unexpected death , one or more shattered romances , and a seemingly insoluble mystery.collins cleverly tells the story from the point of view of several partcipants in the mystery . this plot device allows collins to introduce a host of interesting characters , to engage with the strict social mores of victorian england , and to manipulate several plot devices that extend the detection process to the very end of the novel . readers used to the standard 200 page detective novel of the present day will just have to be patient ; collins takes his time getting to his destination.this reviewer advises readers to save sandra kemp 's excellent introductory essay until after reading the novel itself ; it contains a number of spoilers . & # 34 ; the moonstone & # 34 ; itself is very highly recommended as an entertaining reading experience .

> i needed to replace my hot tools ceramic tourmaline flat iron that bit the dust after a year or so of use . i loved the hot tools iron but thought it should have lasted longer . i limped along using an old flat iron for a few weeks until my hair look terrible . i did my research , found the hsi and its great reviews and decided to give it a try . wow ! i shared with my co-workers that i 'd ordered it and brought it to work for everyone to check out when it was delivered . we used a coffee break to `` do hair '' and everyone agreed that hair was silkier and more shiny after just one use . i 've been using it for a couple of weeks now and i love how my hair looks and feels . i straighten after washing and drying and my hair needs only minor touchups for days until the next shampoo . the unit is easy to handle and use , love the swivel cord and adjustable heat control . the only drawback i 've seen , albeit a minor and manageable one , is the controls seem awkwardly placed . i do n't really have a better suggestion for where to place them but in my opinion their placement is odd . may just be me . i 'd give this 5-stars on performance and price . great investment for anyone wanting to purchase a professional quality flat iron at a reasonable price . the hot tools iron did n't hold a candle to the hsi !

> the usb cable included with wd passport is faulty . even though it supports the usb 3.0 speeds , when i try to move over large files sizes ( 2gb+ per video file ) , the wd passport crashes and i end up with a corrupted file and a semi-faulty drive.the drive i bought is the 2tb version . and the rpm is a consumer standard , meager 5400 rpm . then again , you get what you pay for , so the price is decent.i have tested this with a third-party usb 3.0 cable and the transfer moves over successfully without any hiccups.i wish they just included a y-cable that has a usb 3.0 for transfer and a usb 2.0 for power . the reason for this is because i tried this with a powered anker usb 3.0 hub and the data transfer still fails.not long after , the wd drive ended up corrupted/inaccessible even from a third-party usb 3.0 cable so i tried to format it . the drive became faulty after the format and would not be recognized.the product is beautiful , but if it does n't work , there 's no need to buy from wd when there are many competitors out there with cheaper or faster external hdd's.i would like to thank amazon for fantastic customer service in refunding me my purchase.i would not recommend this product to others until they replace the standard ~5 & # 34 ; usb 3.0 cable with a y-cable .

> michael w. smith has released two previous christmas cds , and they are staples of my december . this new release will be taking an honored place beside them in my december rotation.this release is a combination of his two previous releases . it mixes the choral feeling of the first one with the pop of the second one . and , as something new , he mixes in lots of instrumental pieces . 5 of the 11 songs are fully instrumental . but the orchestra sounds wonderful.what is truly amazing is that this release sounds christmassy from start to finish from the very first listen . only one track , `` what child is this '' is a traditional piece . michael wrote or co-wrote everything else . yet everything feels like an old familiar friend.some of the instrumental tracks sound like the soundtrack to a movie . and one feels like a missing piece from the nutcracker.of the other songs , most focus on the birth of christ . they are wonderful choir pieces . `` christmas day '' focuses on our modern christmas celebration , and it brings a smile to my face as i think about all the traditions . finally , the disc closes with `` all year long , '' a quiet song that wishes us the happiness of christmas the rest of the year.this is a great release . buy it and enjoy it for christmases to come .

> in 1941 , a girl named lynne vincent was born in the wyoming oil patch town of caspar , population 18,000 people . `` blue skies , no fences '' is her extraordinarily honest and highly readable memoir of her youth in caspar , up through her departure for college . `` blue skies , no fences '' is told in two directions . in one direction , lynne provides the chronological story of her childhood and teenage years in a small town where everyone knows , or knows of , everyone else , and young people 's lives are shaped by their parents , teachers , and friends . lynne vincent pulls no punches in her narrative ; family and friends are described fully , warts and all , as is the era of the 1940 's and '50s . lynne vincent was fortunate enough to be born a gifted child , and even more fortunate to encouraged to develop those gifts by the adults around her as she grew up.the second direction of the story is lynne vincent 's tracing of her family roots back to europe , and the progress of her ancestors through generations and jobs to the town of caspar . this portion represents some significant amount of research , and while it can get hard to follow , it is worth the effort.towards the end of the book , the man who would become lynne vincent 's husband makes his appearence . this young man , quiet , intelligent , hardworking , and athletic , would attract her interest in high school . the closing chapters are about their friendship , their dates , and their senior prom . as it turns out , the young dick cheney was only one of several of lynne vincent 's classmates at caspar who went on to make their mark in the world . `` blue skies , no fences '' is very highly recommended as a well-written and thoughtful capture of a time and a place .

> when my wife asked me what i wanted for my birthday , i told her `` a kindle . '' i got my present early -- right before a 12 day trip to italy -- and have enjoyed it immensley . the `` global '' new kindle is flat , light , easy-to-read , and user-friendly . i barely glanced at the instructions before purchasing three books that i wanted to read on the long flight from florida to rome . it was a pleasant alternative to trying to pack 3 heavy , bulky tomes into a carry-on . except for a few brief periods during take-off and landings , the kindle could be read during the entire flight.while purchasing a kindle is certainly more expensive than buying 3 books for the trip , in the long-run it turns out to be an economical choice . most classics can be down-loaded for free . one of the novels i wanted to read only cost $ 2.20 . and even best-sellers are a mere $ 9 or $ 10 when they would only be available in hardback for two to three times the price . in the past , i 'd have to wait for the paperback edition to afford the books i wanted . now i can download them instantly for a fraction of the cost.kindle is most affordable for those who read a lot . i devour a minimum of 3 - 4 books a month . i would n't recommend it for the person who only reads a few books a year . but for those with a voracious appetite , it makes financial sense.there 's no more waiting for a book in the mail , paying shipping costs , etc . convenience , ease of use , portability , and near-instant downloads : what more could i ask for . thanks , honey , for a great birthday present !

> this is another fascinating book by bill o'reilly that is impossible to put down . i carried my kindle into airports and hospitals reading this book every moment i could . it 's a great history lesson . mr. o'reilly recreates the anxiety of that era when american came close to nuclear war . he recreates the horror and incompetence over the failure of the bay of pigs fiasco to recapture cuba from castro . he captures in great detail the character and personality of john kennedy and the risks he took with his womanizing and the heartbreak jackie kennedy went through in her marriage to him . bill o'reilly gives us more detail about lee harvey oswald and his life than i 've read in other books about kennedy . however , what is utterly missing from this masterpiece is the volume of details that have emerged about any conspiracy that could have taken place around the killing of president kennedy . the american people deserve to know the truth about what happened to john kennedy on that fateful day in november , and bill o'reilly , for some reason just does n't want to get into it . he gives a detailed and graphic description of the mortal wounds sustained by the president and how the doctors fought to save him , but all the details found in dozens of other books about other shooters , conspiracy theories , etc. , are simply ignored in this book leaving the reader at the end grasping for more .
= a masterpiece lacking an explanation

> i had n't heard of the scissor sisters until i heard several songs from their second - and latest - album `` ta-dah '' . i understand now why they are so popular in the united kingdom , offering a bold update on classic 1970s and 1980s rock and disco from the likes of the bee gees , abba , and of course , sir elton john himself . `` ta-dah '' is truly an intriguing mix of different styles , with a strong emphasis on glam rock and disco from the mid to late 1970s . indeed my favorite song is the album 's opening track - and first hit single - `` i do n't feel like dancin ' '' which sounds as if it could have been written by elton john and bernie taupin back in the mid 1970s ( think `` bitch is back '' crossed with `` do n't go breaking my heart '' ) ; not surprisingly , elton has a songwriting credit in helping to compose the music and plays the piano convincingly . another fine song on this album that he also co-wrote , `` intermission '' , is much darker in tone , and stylistically seems more akin to music from the likes of blondie and the clash . this intriguing new york city-based band truly has a bright future ahead , which will include substantial interest from new fans here in the united states .
= mostly up-tempo , fun , intelligent pop with touches of glam rock and disco

> the premise of `` iris '' is simple enough , but the history of iris murdoch and her long time lover john bayley is a thing of fascination . told through a series of flashbacks comparing the slowly ailing iris to the younger courtship years of writers iris and john bayley , it 's a masterpiece of editing . iris is no sweet angel of the literary world , but a confrontative liberal progressive willing to explore every part of life she can indulge in . this proves a quandary for the young john bayley ( played by an amazing look-alike named hugh bonneville ) , whose is rather shy , but hopelessly in love with iris . the acting is beyond superb with kate winslet as the young murdoch.admittedly , there are the weepy moments when iris adamantly refuses to give in to this disease , all in vain . there are the struggles with herself and her lover . the literary metaphors and ironies are abundant ( `` there is only one freedom of any importance , freedom of the mind '' ) and the visual ones are somewhat clich & eacute ; . regardless , this is a fascinating work of acting by some incredible talents of our age . it 's not always upbeat , but it makes you appreciate what you have and how little it takes to be happy .

> after journey frontman steve perry released his solo album street talk in 1984 , he reunited with his fellow members to record this album . they would disband for ten years after this album . all the songs on this album have been published by street talk tunes , inspired by perry 's solo album . for legal reasons , the lyrics to the title track do not appear on the lp inner sleeve and the cd booklet ( i do n't know if the cassette carries the lyrics ) . the title track contains song titles and sample lyrics from previous hit songs recorded by other artists . just to avoid the possibility of lawsuits , it has been decided not to display the title track 's lyrics . hit songs from this album are girl ca n't help it , be good to yourself and i 'll be alright without you . suzanne was a minor hit . that 's why it does not appear on the greatest hits compilation , released in 1988. why ca n't this night go on forever ? is a beautiful love ballad like frontiers ' faithfully . all the other songs are great .
= awesome album !

> josh lanyon has become an autobuy for me , i 've read several of his books and they written to a consistently high standard . he has n't disappointed yet ! fair game follows elliot , terribly wounded while working for the fbi , now recovering having resigned from the fbi and lost his boyfriend/colleague at the same time . elliot is now working as a professor at the same college where his father taught for many years . but something odd is going on , and this brings tucker lance , fbi agent , back into elliot 's life.i enjoyed the mystery , but i really loved the dynamic between elliot and tucker , how they misunderstood each other and let each other down after the terrible shooting and then struggled back to a kind of friendship and then something more.i rate this a keeper and a reread , and while not as gripping as adrien english ( well , i have n't read 5 books with them yet , give it a chance ... ) and i for one would be delighted to meet these characters again .

> i am , however , a fan of good acting , believable characters , and bottomless cgi budgets . and strong , cute women like that buzz-cut israeli soldier . oh , it had its weak spots , but pretty much the ones you 'd expect of any zombie movie . and i do n't think any modern lab dealing in bsl3 agents would take such a casual approach to their storge and access . and ... well , even shakespeare requires some suspension of disbelief on occasion , so i ca n't call that a dire flaw.i went in looking for some good summer entertainment and a spot in the air conditioning . i came out impressed by one of the better movies of the 2013 summer season. -- wiredweird , reviewing the release to theaters

> this is a nice light weight case and seems to hold the kindle well . it does not have the bells and whistles of many other covers , like turning on your kindle automatically or having a stand to hold the kindle up . of course like most there is also no provision for a stylus - that would be a huge addition . this provides as much protection as other covers at a lower cost.my only complaint is the strap . it is sewn on , in the inside edge of the back cover . when you turn the strap over the back to open the cover it snaps and twists very easily . this is also leading to it starting to stretch out which has not happened with other covers i have had .
= awkward strap
< nice light weight case

> legendary director john ford 's last film , while not as good as earlier efforts , does possess some striking photography , a brilliant alex north score , and good acting . stalwart richard widmark does well as the cavalryman with a conscious ; karl malden is fine as the duty-bound fort commander ; and edward g. robinson does his patented perfection as a politician who tries to placate the situation . even the politically incorrect casting of non-indians ricardo montalban , delores del rio , sal mineo , and gilbert roland can be excused as a sign of the film making times . veteran character actor sean mcclory is also quite memorable as the fort doctor who confronts captain malden about the mistreatment of the indian prisoners .

> i like to have a lot of batteries stockpiled at home in case of earthquakes , etc . plus we just plain have a lot of electronic gadgets that go through these batteries . if you do the math , this is a very good deal for batteries . as far as i can tell these are of recent manufacture and do the job at a lot cheaper price than if you buy in retail stores . duracells rightly have a reputation as being good batteries.one thing you should know is that the batteries do not come packaged as shown in the photo . they come in an unmarked white box ; not shrink wrapped . not sure what is up with that . rjb .

> with two selections - back on the road again and only the strong survive - that became signature numbers for the band , this july 1979 release solidified them as a mainstay on the arena rock schedule.the nine cuts on the ninth release of the group clocks in at 34:24 and includes a cover of chuck berry 's classic , rock & roll music . drifting back to the past with a more hard rock sound , the band 's tour to support the album included the songs being played in order , note-for-note.known more for the live performances , reo speedwagon comes very close in capturing that energy in arguably their best studio album .

> i have loved my netflix for years , and i am ecstatic to have this app for my kindle fire hd 8.9 & # 34 ; great for around the house or wherever else you have a good wi-fi connection . it would be great if they would license for temporary download so that you could view offline , but may that will be in the near future !

> ` nowhere but home ' is the story of queenie , who is not such a sympathetic character at times . she is arrogant and self-destructive . she manages to get herself fired from numerous chef positions and finally goes home to north star , texas . she left there years ago , the daughter of the town floozy who is murdered in bed with her best friend 's husband - by that friend . queenie along with her sister and her sister 's ` fatherless ' son are the town pariahs.there are no surprises or twists in the plot line , it turns out just the way a romance is supposed to ; but , what at first seems like fluff turns into something , at times more philosophical . queenie starts cooking the last meals for death row prisoners , so we are also introduced to the joys of texas cooking.the storyline is rife in how a town treats those with a ` reputation ' . there 's more here than first appears and it makes one muse on these behaviors . however it is somehow difficult to be understanding concerning queenie and her obsessions . her sister seems to be the one a reader would care more for.queenie 's secret love , everett , ( that everyone in town is aware of and also of every other ` secret ' too ) lacks depth as do many of the characters . still they slowly grow on you , even though it is hard to be caring about all the stressing to their psyche that occurs ; it is all schmaltzy and improbable - but then at times , that is what romance is all about .

> annette leblanc cate has written an informative and humorous book for children about bird watching . however after reading it , i felt any adult new to bird watching would gain valuable advice from her detailed book . annette made it very clear that you do not need special equipment to watch birds , nor do you have to travel other than your own backyard either . she encourages children to use their eyes to observe , notebooks to draw , and of course her book to locate specific characteristics of birds.she included questions to assist children in their viewing : does the brown bird have any special markings on its body ? what kind of beak does it have ? annette includes pages showing : various bird beak shapes , silhouettes of birds , nest shapes and locations , and more information that is not only interesting but she makes it fun to read . she included drawings of many of the popular birds in different parts of our world.this complete book for children is the best one i have seen . if you have a child interested in nature and especially birds , i encourage you to locate a copy of annette 's book . * i received a copy of this book for review - all opinions are my own*

> four stars might be a little generous . let me break this down . john swenson is an excellent writer , 2007 best music writing award , 2008 best entertainment feature award , editor of crawdaddy , rolling stone , circus , rock world , offbeat and writer of numerous books . he is part of the music industry and knows it well . make no mistake he knows music , new orleans , its characters and what happen after katrina . that 's what this book is about , the music industry in new orleans recovering after katrina . it is full of information and stories , covering jazz , hip hop , brass bands , funk , rock and more . and that is the lynch pin of my starred rating , there is too much . this book is almost like a single edition history of the civil war , huge , full of facts , too much for one edition . a stories and antidotes would just get going and the chapter would change . give me more ! ! this book should be three or more , with more details more information on the performers.it is very information packed and well written but lacking in depth . too much too fast , therefore dry .

> before making my own review of this book , i glanced through a few previous reviews , and it seems everyone has arguments over this book over some reason or another . as a civilian , and currently in a relationship with a navy man myself , i completely respect what these men ( and women ! ) do for us and feel honored they put their lives on the line so that we may keep on living the freedom this country has fought so hard to win - and continues to fight for . true , marcus 's book was at times shocking - contemplating the lives of unarmed civilians , the way he kept blaming liberal media , etc . i managed to ignore his personal opinions and issues and kept focused on his mission and his struggle to get out of there alive . i loved this book - it was heart wrenching and it gave the reader an inside look as to what our military does to get the job done . while some parts of the book were a little too opinionated for my taste , i 'm still extremely proud of our men and women who fight for our freedom and this book is just one example of that.the last saint

> once upon a time , ghost was a valued part of the sophisticated computer user or , more appropriately , network administrator 's toolkit . that was a long time ago before symantec acquired the product and , in my opinion , pretty much ruined it.the newest version offers the user no features they can not get in competitive packages , often implemented more effectively.typical of symantec products , ghost 14 is a resource hog and prone to failure - not something you want in a package that supposedly protects you by backing up your files.the interface is poor . documentation is fair.performance is okay , but a number of people have complained about restore failures . that is , as you can imagine , one thing you do not want to hear about backup and restore software - that the restore function is problematic or does n't work.backup file format seems to be proprietary which is also bothersome . i do n't want to be a slave to some publisher 's proprietary format.on the whole , i am wary of ghost these days and prefer other products which are equally or better featured , less expensive , have better reputations and seem to be more reliable.jerry

> john denver 's music makes one think of high altitudes , pine forests and pure mountain air . this collection includes his huge hits take me home country roads , starwood in aspen , sunshine on my shoulders and rocky mountain high , plus other greart songs like rhymes and reasons , poems , prayers and promises and leaving on a jet plane , his composition that was one of peter , paul and mary 's biggest hits . denver had a knack for soaring melodies and his pure voice lifts the spirit . the criticism is that his music is one dimensional but i feel that what he did , he did exceptionally well . he was the pastoral bard of america 's unspoilt nature , of the wide spaces , the mountains , the forests and the sky . the tunes are sublime and whether you like his pristine country/folk sound or not , he was a great composer . another good collection is the greatest country hits which contains 18 tracks . but this is still a valuable collection of his greatest chart hits , most of them from the early to middle 1970s .

> this book is something of a follow-up to newton 's debut novel , calumet city : a novel , though only minor characters actually overlap between the two books . which was perhaps the only disappointing thing about this book - i wanted more of an update about patti black . otherwise , i loved the book in all of its sad , sweet , brutal and thrilling glory . newton 's narrative style is well-matched with his gritty version of chicago . this book is divided between two narrators ( with each section clearly marked ) , but i must say that bobby vargas was more of the star of the book than arleen brennan . newton handled the female point-of-view more convincingly with patti black , but arleen was still sympathetic . the plot was certainly unpredictable and all of the plot points fit nicely together in the end without being contrived . all in all , this book had a very realistic feel to it - though some of this realism would be undoubtedly be lost on non-chicagoans . i am really looking forward to seeing what newton writes next !

> this book was rather a disappointment for me . i was initially intrigued by the concepts being advanced by the author , but quickly lost my interest . the plot was very slow-moving , the technical aspects of the book were explained rather awkwardly , and the scenes changed very abruptly . i think what bothered me most about the book was the inappropriate amount of attention that was devoted to aspects of the main character , his `` new body , '' and all that that entailed . in my opinion , when you major on the minors , the minors become major . several scenes completely stopped the flow of the action , and you were left with images that would be best left unimagined . for these reasons , i would not recommend this book.the writing is good . stellar . it would make an excellent movie . 5 stars for that.the part i mentioned , 1 star . average - 3 stars .

> with newer android os 's this application is not really needed . the developer does a decent job of listing out what is staying resident and running in the back ground , but for the most part android already does the job of cleaning up after itself . it was interesting to see what was running , but honestly , there were n't any surprises . so in the end , since this is probably doing nothing more but putting a drain on my phone , i uninstalled it . it really is n't needed . it would be like having an app to show you were payphones are . it is just unneeded and outdated .

> kyle hadley : i 'll kill him ! marylee hadley : a whiskey bottle 's about all you 'd kill.how ironic that douglas sirk , a german-born director , came to be synonymous with capturing what we now regard as the quintessential technicolor-soaked `` american look '' in his series of 1950s screen melodramas . written on the wind ( 1956 ) is one of the best from this master filmmaker.based on the novel by robert wilder , written on the wind is the story of the texas oil-rich hadley clan . when kyle hadley ( robert stack ) impulsively marries his father 's latest secretary lucy moore ( lauren bacall ) , everything seems happy enough ; yet kyle hides a catalogue of fears and anxieties from a life spent in his father 's imposing shadow , going so far as to sleep with a gun under his pillow . when kyle suspects his best friend mitch wayne ( rock hudson ) of carrying on an affair with lucy -- a rumour embellished by kyle 's outrageous , nympho sister marylee ( dorothy malone ) -- he reaches the breaking point ... fine performances all around in arguably one of douglas sirk 's most audacious movies . sirk favourite rock hudson is especially impressive , and robert stack gives one of his most vulnerable performances as kyle . dorothy malone won the 'best supporting actress ' academy award for her scene-chewing role of marylee . in contrast to malone , lauren bacall ca n't help fading into the background but still manages to hold her own in the scenes with stack.sirk clearly enjoyed the particular star dynamic of rock hudson , dorothy malone and robert stack , who 'd all be reunited in his `` tarnished angels '' two years later , playing another stormy love triangle .

> i 've been a big fan of james mcmurtry ever since the release of his fabulous debut album , & quot ; too long in the wasteland & quot ; back in 1989. unfortunately , it pains me to report that his four-year hiatus between studio releases has apparently not reenergized his songwriting . the problem asserts itself right away on & quot ; saint mary of the woods , & quot ; musically , the first two songs simply cannibalize mcmurtry 's back catalog . & quot ; dry river , & quot ; despite being a dave alvin cover , is a sweeping epic that sounds like several others from the mid period of his career ; while & quot ; valley road & quot ; sounds like an outtake from the debut album . then comes the title track , which takes entirely too long to unfold at over six minutes.all that said , this is not a bad album . the production is crisp and clean , mcmurtry is in fine voice and can still turn a clever lyrical phrase as well as any songwriter . it 's just that for the most part , none of the tracks on the album stand out . in the past , mcmurtry 's best music could get you humming and thinking at the same time . on & quot ; saint mary 's & quot ; the humming factor is largely missing . fro example , the closing tack & quot ; choctaw bingo & quot ; is eight minutes long with a lyrics sheet that looks like one of mcmurtry 's dad 's novels . by the end of it you feel like you 've read one.overall , a average album that does n't stand up to mcmurtry 's best work .

> amongst the vampire and shifter communities vampire executioner anita blake is notorious for her dead count ; no one in the profession comes remotely close . however , recently she has had a catharsis of sorts as those she assumed are evil monsters may be the victims of a zealous bias by human society who has fears of the paranormal . part of her mental revision is who she socializes with , which has led to the federal marshal service no longer trusting her in spite of her record.however , anita has no doubts that the serial killing vampire vittorio who recently left st. louis deserves death . he has begun taunting her sending her a victim 's head via the post office . she takes up his gauntlet heading to las vegas where the package came from to confront him . in town are federal marshal edward and serial killer olaf ; both want anita . in sin city , the sheriff wants anita to leave while others like crispin the were-tiger and marmee noir the creator of the vampire lines have uses for anita ; all hell is converging on anita . ; other supernatural entities have a use for her as well.skin trade is the best blake urban fantasy in several years as the story line is a throwback to the earlier supernatural detective thrillers . sex is limited instead of dominating and what there is enhances the storyline instead of owning the plot . fascinatingly except for edward there is no direct appearance of any other recurring support character as anita using her brain more than her brawn and struggles with being the foci of the vegas paranormal community.harriet klausner

> i can say without reservations that the new horror novel so cold the river is the best ghost story ever set in real life french lick , indiana . also unusual is the use as a major plot device of the equally genuine laxative `` pluto water '' that was popular in the early 20th century . this real , well researched and unusual setting and premise helped me greatly enjoy the first half of the book . unfortunately the second half and especially the last few pages degenerated to a typical mediocre thriller.eric is the protagonist and a bit of an anti-hero as he has some less than sterling qualities . a talented but failed documentary filmmaker with some psychic abilities he is hired by a rich chicago woman to make a film about her dying father-in-law . eric travels to southern indiana to research his subject 's past in the recently revitalized tourist area of french lick . there with the aid of the mysterious pluto water bottle from the last century he increasingly begins to see visions of the area 's less than savory past.this is a lengthy book with quite a few characters many of whom are not well developed . a quote on the cover compares the book to the writings of stephen king and peter straub . i can see the comparison to those two masters as worthy at times in so cold the river . in fact if i had stopped at the halfway point in this novel it would likely have received five stars from me . unfortunately the predictable , silly and contrived second half makes me rate it as `` just ok . ''

> these are cool temperature , and bright , bulbs that fit in any normal sized incandescent light fixture . typical of other led lights , there is about a half second delay from when you flip the switch to the bulb turning on.i 'm not sure , however , i would call these a daylight-looking bulb as the two i installed in a hallway fixture have more of a white / blue florescent coloring vs. a true incandescent yellow substitute . that does n't bother me , but it does bother my wife as she says the color does n't match the other bulbs we have in the house ( a mixture of daylight led 's and incandescent bulbs , at least until the incandescent bulbs finally burn out ) .the energy savings - from the bulb and not as much heat generation that requires the air conditioner to kick on - the instant on vs. taking a while to warm up like cfl 's , combined with the long life and not having to purchase more bulbs over time like incandescent bulbs are pretty good : i just need tomove these bulbs to a closet or something . if you 're looking to save some long-term cash with an investment today , i would recommend these led bulbs .

> charlie is still the same humble girl from before she was queen . but now she battles the malevolent former queen from inside her own head . this is like multiple personality disorder , but where both personalities are aware of each other . the rising unrest within her own country must take a backseat when charlie decides to join the summit of the neighboring realms . then , on the way to summit it becomes clear that there is a traitor in their midst . charlie is completely out of her element surrounded by the other queens , but because of her innocence and humility , she still seems to be welcomed . and suddenly charlie 's relationship with max becomes complicated when she begins to feel a pull towards someone she has just met.this is an absorbing and moving sequel to last year 's the pledge . derting weaves a complex plot with engaging characters . full of suspense , intrigue , drama , and a bit of romance - the essence is a fantastic novel that is nearly impossible to put down . just as enjoyable as the first , this sequel builds to an exciting conclusion that left me pining for the next ( and final ) installment in this unique dystopian fantasy trilogy .

> it 's rare to read a memoir or autobiography where the author is as frank and revealing as portia de rossi . unbearable lightness describes de rossi 's long obsession with personal perfection that takes her down a dark and lonely path of purging in an attempt to keep herself rail thin while dealing with her sexuality . as she pumps herself full of a lethal cocktail of various diuretics to attain her goal , her world spins out of control.this is not a happy story for the most part . since her breakout part in the tv series ally mcbeal , her obvious batttle with her weight was chronicled on tv and the internet as every slight deviation in her size was reported and duly photographed . she tells her story in a straightforward manner , and despite her exceptional physical appearance there is such a resounding sense of truth in her words that it is a story that i found plausible and easy to relate to.in getting healthy finally , de rossi gets to the core of knowing and liking/accepting herself as she truly is.this is a great introspective read for anyone who has image problems or anyone who is gay . whatever your personal demons , this book is not only interesting but thought provoking .

> & # 34 ; arielle : immortal awakening ( immortal rapture , # 1 ) & # 34 ; by lilian roberts is a beautifully written paranormal romance.the book starts with 16 year old arielle and two of her fiends experimenting with psychic powers and mediumship and opening themselves up to the world of spirits.as the three school friends come back from their summer break they encounter more of that world , some of it through the men they fall for . sadly not all of this is good.the characters of arielle 's friends are well chosen as they allow the plot to spread out and to explore the experiences from slightly different angles.on her vacation in france arielle herself falls for sebastian , an immortal , which becomes the main story.the book incorprates a lot of supernatural / paranormal elements , e.g . witch craft and a place between this world and the next . with its wide ranging themes the book stands out from one trick ponies and books limited to only one idea.this is a wonderful and accomplished fantasy novel with a truly beautiful love story at its heart .

> this documentary follows two mother cats , a lion and a cheetah , as they try to protect their cubs on the african savanna.adults who have even a minimal layman 's knowledge of these magnificent animals will probably not get much new information , but they will be treated to incredible visuals that will unfortunately lose much of their power on most home screens . filmmakers alastair fothergill and keith scholey have really captured some extraordinary images . children are likely to be captivated . my own four-year-old son was challenged a bit by the 90 minute running time , but was frequently drawn in by what was on the screen and finally declared it to be `` so much fun .

> when i first saw the star wars darth vader helmet , i got really excited . a few years ago there was a darth vader voice changer helmet that was for sale that when you placed it one it could synthesize your voice so that whatever you said would sound like darth vader . it sold for about $ 30- $ 50 and though i 'm a star wars fan , i did n't have a lot of extra cash and just could n't justify the cost . so , when the opportunity presented itself to get a new star wars darth vader helmet , i could n't pass it up . the packaging clearly states it 's an & # 34 ; electronic helmet & # 34 ; and some of the advertising i 've seen have promoted this as something that will let the person wearing it & # 34 ; sound like darth. & # 34 ; that 's only half-true . you can sound like darth , but only because there is a button on the side of this mask that has a few pre-programmed darth phrases that it repeats . also , this is n't really a helmet , but a heavy-duty mask . a helmet fits completely over one 's head . this is a mask that straps on the back . so , when wearing the star wars darth vader electronic helmet a person looks like vader from the front , but from the back their head is exposed . for children , this is a high quality mask that is n't as bulky as a helmet and probably more enjoyable to wear and play with . however , for adults the star wars darth vader helmet is a let down ; it wo n't complete your costume and it wo n't allow you to sound like vader and as far as collectibles go , the previously released darth vader voice changer helmet is the way to go . overall , great for kids , but not so much for grown-ups .

> i appear to be one of the few reviewers who feel equally comfortable reviewing any political album , irrespective of whether it supports the left or the right . maybe this is because i 've seen enough that no political ideology has all the answers , and i do n't have the answers either . i therefore find it interesting to hear all the viewpoints , even though i disagree with some of them . here , ry cooder points out plenty of problems as he sees them . he clearly feels passionate about politics , but like the rest of us , he does not have the solutions.musically , i would describe this as a folk-blues album in which ry cooder sings in a nearly-speaking style . his prowess as a musician sometimes shows through , but if you really want to hear ry cooder the musician , you have to go back to the earlier albums that he recorded before he decided to focus on political music . this reminds me that i should re-acquaint myself with chicken skin music , which i have n't heard for over 30 years.ry cooder spends a lot of the album attacking the republicans , beginning with the opening song in which he sings the part of mitt romney 's dog . judging by the references in four songs to jim crow ( brother in song , cold , cold feeling . going to tampa , take your hands off it ) , it appears that he thinks the republicans would like to return to a time when blacks and whites lived segregated lives in america.committed democrat voters will probably love the sentiments expressed here , but i doubt if it 's the kind of album that would convince an undecided voter that they should vote democrat . the one thing missing from this album is a song that offers hope for the future . nevertheless , this is still an enjoyable album .

> this is about as false an advertisement as it is possible to produce . for starters , this is not anywhere close to 8 '' in height . depending on what part of the mattress you are measuring it is anywhere from 4 '' to 6 '' . the mattress come as three sections that are sewn together on one side . two of the sections are held together with a zipper on the opposite side of the sewn side . the other two sections are sewn on one side but lack the zipper on the other side so they just flop around . the three section arrangement means that the mattress is as lumpy as all get out . another reason for the lumpiness is that the cover is made for a much smaller mattress in length , width and height . one you stuff the mattress into the undersized cover you have a horrible bed that only a delusional dog would attempt to lie on . my dobie took one look at it , turned up his nose and walked away in disgust never to look at it again.i could go on but see no point since this is a genuine disaster about which many falsehoods are given in the product description . even the product itself varies as indicated in the reviews where some get a two part mattress and others , like me , get a 3 part version . some covers apparently fit and some are completely wrong sized . this product is not worthy of anymore of my time so into the trash it goes . i will always remember to stay away from the armarkat brand .

> this might be the most poorly-conceived book cover ever . the heroine of lucy maud montgomery 's classic `` anne of green gables '' was famously a feisty ( but modest ) red-head , unlike the completely inappropriate blonde on the original cover of this edition.lucy maud montgomery 's beloved 1908 novel `` anne of green gables '' and its first two sequels , `` anne of avonlea '' and `` anne of the island '' , are readily available in many editions . the stories follow an imaginative red-haired eleven year-old orphan from her accidental arrival on a small farm on canada 's prince edward island , through her teenage years , her time as the schoolmarm in the village of avonlea , and her time in college , ending with her engagement to `` the right guy . '' anne 's story continues past this point , but the first three novels form a wonderful narrative arc about anne 's quest for love and are very highly recommended to fans of the series .

> these small cuts of pasta are great in soup yet versatile enough to use in other dishes . they do hold their shape and tend to absorb the flavor of the sauce . so far i have made a minestrone soup and substituted them for noodles in my mother 's sauerbraten recipe . i also prepared them with a standard marinara sauce.the small size is ideal of children and people like my mother who has difficulties with manual dexterity since suffering a stroke . frankly , i never gave much thought to pasta brands , usually opting for whatever was cheapest or whatever i had a coupon for . my results were , not surprisingly , inconsistent and frequently unmemorable . i really noticed a difference with the barilla , in texture and taste . truly a revelation . recommended .

> if you are wondering whether you want a pedometer , let me add my vigorous `` yes '' . wearing a pedometer has a way of making you parse every step you take as exercise ... .even walking down the hall to ask an officemate a question raises your step count just a bit , and soon enough you will be raising your ambitions to 10,000 steps a day or even more without needing to make a production over going to the gym.if you are wondering `` which pedometer , '' i 'll add my pitch for this nifty little omron . my last pedometer : inaccurate , physically uncomfortable , impossible to wear with a dress , broke after 2 months.my omron : accurate , comfortable clip , even works if i just stick it in a pocket or purse , have dropped it frequently to no ill effects . best of all , it has quite sophisticated features : it tracks not only steps , miles , and calories , but `` aerobic steps '' - if you keep walking for 10 minutes or more it counts as aerobic - it is even smart enough to let you pause for up to a minute and still count subsequent steps as aerobic . finally , it has a 7-day memory that allows you to track all these features back a whole week so you can see your improvements.i ca n't say enough about this product . i know they call it `` premium '' but for less than the cost of a couple of weeks at a gym , you 'll have a permanent and genuinely practical exercise system . it is the best fitness value of any kind on the market .

> this is about as simple as it gets - there is no text on how to draw the gnomes , etc. , but what you get is a series of pencil / brush strokes as the author shows you each step of the process . i had my kindle fire on one side of the table and a legal pad of paper right next to it as i doodled away . the first 3-4 tries i followed it step-by-step , but on the fifth one i did it solo from memory and am now making my own variations . the funny thing is , if i 'm doodling away while at a meeting at work someone leaned over and said `` i did n't know you could draw ! '' i ca n't - but this book really helps you out.as i mentioned above , i was using this with a kindle fire ( 8.9 '' screen ) and it worked great ; it 's not so good on my kindle keyboard ( which is understandable ) . i originally picked this up for free during a kindle promotion and , as i type up this review , the price has reverted back to $ 5.99 ; if you want to learn how to draw gnomes or other caricatures , i would recommend this one - if this non-artist can do it , you can , too . if $ 5.99 is above your price range in an effort to try it out , you might pick up one of the individual books in the series vs. this compilation of three titles .

> i live a long way from anywhere , and was very dubious about my ability to receive free to air tv . however , a few months ago i cut the cable cord and had been getting by with netflix and hulu . i was curious about trying an antenna and the reviews for this sounded so good i thought what the hell . i used to work in a tv store and have a lot of memories of trying to tune in ( analog ) tvs , going through various wavy lines , snow etc . i thought that was going to be my experience here.when it arrived and i took it out of the box i thought i 'd been conned . it looks and feels like a thin sheet of plastic . nevertheless , i plugged it into the tv , stuck it on the wall with some tape ( did n't want to mount it properly yet because i was sure it would be going back in the box in a minute ) , and pressed scan on the tv.wow ! ! ! - full hd channels ! this thing is amazing ! definitely the best $ 40 i 've spent in a long time.according the the website , my town only receives nbc and pbs free to air , and that 's what i 've got ( so i do n't blame the antenna , it 's all there is out there to receive ) .very pleased with this , and definitely recommend it .

> i am not a paleontologist ( obviously ) . i am not , truth be told , even a dinosaur fanatic . what i am is a reader who is always looking to extend my knowledge base on interesting subjects , and this dinosaur encyclopedia fulfills that quest in spades ! everything you could ever want to know about dinosaurs -- all types , all genuses , all sizes and shapes and colors -- is detailed , extensively , within the pages of dinosaurs . there are wonderful illustrations by luis v. rey , timelines , graphs , rock cycles , detailed drawings of skeletons -- you name it , and this book has it . with an appendix that includes a 48-page dinosaur genus list and a glossary of hundreds of terms , this is pretty much the only encyclopedia on dinosaurs that you 're ever going to need.i 'm sure that some scientifically-minded people will yearn to find something that is missing , and they may even find it . but for the general dinosaur lover , this is definitely the book to add to your collection . although the reading level is too advanced for younger children , those over the age of eight will find plenty to keep them interested and entertained.dinosaurs is highly recommended for classroom and home libraries , or as the perfect present for that dinosaur crazy kid on your gift list.reviewed by : jennifer wardrip , aka `` the genius ''

> deep purple , version 2 was torn apart in the early 70 's at the height of their power and sales . with this hugely popular release they stormed back in full power . this one was as if they had never left . with songs like perfect stranger and other radio played songs , fans could only hope that this was to last . it did n't , but at least we have this great cd to remember this reunion again . there is n't a weak song on here and we do n't see any of the funk influence of deep purple circa 1974-76. not that those releases were bad it 's just that this is what dp does best : make excellent hard rock . ian gilliam is at the top of form here and so is the rest of the band . the late jon lord 's keyboards flow into each song . it 's all great here , in true dp style . of course ritchie blackmore is laying down great guitar work too , among the other purples . deep purple a truly original band shines here . why ca n't the hall of fame see the greatness of this music ? it is insane ! put them in the hall . and rip jon lord .

> one of the most interesting things a major music fan can do is hear a huge band before they got their footing.hearing time and a word is a prime example of how rich an experiance this can be . look even at the cover . it looks nothing like the roger dean trademarks we have come to know.this 1970 album features pete banks , not chris howe . banks was a good player but not as flashy as howe , so the guitar does not play as big of a role hear as it does on the classic yes albums like fragle.strings , however , do play a sizable roll , and the big arrangments on these tracks add an amazing contrast to the flat and open dynamics yes would later use . they almost seem like a wave sweeping over jon anderson 's subtle voice.very strange and intreuging albom

> the third in koontz 's odd thomas series is a mixed blessing . one can see how much koontz must like his leading character : odd thomas is a well-written and likeable guy , whose narrative skills are what keeps the story moving . koontz uses humor a lot in this series and for the most part , effectively.the problem with this entry is its meandering pace and a storyline that just is n't that intriguing or plausible . the supporting characters of the monks and nuns are well done and the mysterious russian librarian is a good addition . overall , though , it 's a little too repetitive and not as chilling as it should have been .

> first , the watchable part . it 's a fair mystery , with a bumbiling watson , a mycroft decidedly on the gray side ( not light or dark , actually , but could go either way ) , and a sherlock with at least his share of human foibles . ennui among them - when assailed by under-excitement , he retreats to his 7 % solution ( watered down to 5 % , by the friend looking out for his health ) .but , since this artifact comes down to us from the 1970s , cold war angst underlies the major plot . super-weapon , german ( east german ? ) spy , layers of intelligence agencies - and all that wrapped around a story that might have dated from the early inklings of wwi . but , the era adds more to the layered anachronisms . a strong leading lady reminds us that women 's lib emerged in the 1970s ( and echoed the suffragettes leading up to the 1920s ) . even more , though , early parts of the movie offer a subversive kind of acceptance of gays . it 's kind of a `` do n't ask do n't tell , but you know and we know '' sort of acceptance , but a thin edge of a wedge nevertheless . maybe the 1970s foretold the 2000-era social change , and maybe they echoed experimental social conventions of the 1920s.a good story in itself , and worth seeing for that reason . but , if you want a melange of social norms chosen from many decades ( and possibly decades in this movie 's future ) , the subtext is well worth reading. -- wiredweird

> i know there are plenty of dream theater live albums available , most of which span 2-3 cds and are jam-packed with songs , but the 1993 ep live at the marquee remains my absolute favorite . part of that is the fact that it features only material fromimages and wordsandwhen dream and day unite , which are two of my favorite dream theater albums , but i think what really makes this brief ( 46 minutes ) performance so memorable is that unlike on later live offerings , the band sounds like a hungry young group just tasting their first piece of success . this was dream theater before the concept albums , before the orchestral dvd , before inspiring countless imitators . there 's an energy here that just is n't the same ononce in a livetime , orscore : xox - 20th anniversary world tour live with the octavarium orchestra , orlive at budokan.beyond this energy is the fact that you get to hear dream theater doing some pre-james labrie material , which is always a treat ( i 'd still love to hear a rerecorded when dream and day unite with labrie singing ) , some of the better songs from images and words , and the very cool 7-minute instrumental bombay vindaloo , which i believe is exclusive to this ep.it may be short , and it may be old , but live at the marquee is still an exceptional performance and remains my favorite dream theater live offering .

> i agree with a number of people that this is a great series and that this book is where the series steps over to be a serious contender in the great mystery series genre . i have enjoyed the books up to now , but they did not really prepare me for the complexity of this novel . robinson 's chief inspector banks is a wonderful creation . this is a book that blends the past and the present and robinson does this seamlessly . we flit back and forth from present-day england to england during the second world war . the book is definitely more than an exciting murder mystery . it is an exploration of human behaviour and it is very provocatively written . banks is currently suffering a bit both in his career and in his personal life , so when a skeleton is discovered buried under a reservoir that has dried up due to drought , he knows that this case will be one that will reshape his career and hopefully add some meaning to his life as he has been trying to get used to be separated from his wife of 20 years . even he does n't anticipate where pursuit of the solution of this case will take him . for anyone who loves to read intelligently written british police procedural mysteries , do not miss peter robinson .

> this one was kind of a let down for me . it 's jamie 's story and i really thought there 'd be more oomph to it , he had so much oomph in book one i mean there were parts i found amusing like the part where he told claire what she was going to do , & # 34 ; no , i wo n't stop it , & # 34 ; jamie growled . & # 34 ; i 've got everything planned out and you 're not going to screw it up again ! you 're not going on any god-damned trip around the world , because you 're going to stay here and become my wife. & # 34 ; claire , i hate to break it to ya sister , but jamie is getting under your skin even if you wo n't admit it out loud , & # 34 ; dinner ? who could think about dinner ? all she could think about was jamie - naked . hard . ready for her . hell , she was ready for him - right now. & # 34 ; hopefully rob 's story has more oomph to it , no matter what i 'm going to finish reading this series !

> if one were to draw up a prescription for writing children 's books , it would surely include large doses of animal subjects . children , as we know , are attracted to animals , especially young animals so linda newbery was on solid ground when she created posy , a rambunctious little kitten.an award winning author , newbery lives in england with her husband and three cats . if one of them was the model for posy her household is both happy and busy.the book is a rhyming diary of posy 's day as she tries in vain to catch a spider , stretches to scratch on the sofa , gets tangled up in a ball of yarn , and does all the things we would expect a kitten to do.illustrator catherine rayner has created an original , enchanting posy , almost a cubist cat , most definitely a calico . the winner of the 2006 booktrust early years award for best new illustrator in the united kingdom , rayner veers from the usual paintings of a cuddly , furry kitten to give us a delightful representation that exudes energy with wiry whiskers , upright tail , and black spot eyes.recommended for ages 2 - 5.- gail cooke

> if you are expecting the book , `` mists of avalon '' by marion zimmer bradley , then you are bound to be disappointed . what can you stuff in a three hour presentation ? everyone has a different idea of the characters and laces.the movie its self was an intriguing production . i especially like the inclusion of the song `` the mystic dream '' by loreena mckennitt as i have many of her albums . the photography was excellent ; if they make a blu-ray version in the future i will buy it again.we not only get a new story form the book but a few anomalies . we catch igraine ( caroline goodall ) spinning flax with her distaff . the spinning wheel was not invented until 13th century asia . it did not get to france until the 18th century . author was around the fifth century.all the actors played their parts well and did not outshine their characters.there may have been a few liberties with the tale . however i enjoyed it to the end.get another take on the story with le morte d'arthur by sir thomas malory and william caxton .

> my parents lived in the berkshires , and my dad knew several people who had posed for norman rockwell in his stockbridge studio . they were playing roles for rockwell 's images that have formed a folk history of the first half of the twentieth century . though posed , the countless images from rockwell 's brush have remained popular , even iconic , representations of this country.in this book , photographer kevin rivoli pairs rockwell paintings with contemporary photos he has taken from across the country and with text from a variety of noted folks . the iconic images remains , it seems , part of normal american life today.it 's easy to be cynical about the carefree and innocent images of rockwell 's america , but their widespread popularity is impossible to ignore . if norman rockwell 's paintings , his america , his icons , are important to you , then this book is highly recommended -- an updating of his ideas to today .

> i was a huge fan of hbo 's & # 34 ; deadwood & # 34 ; . in that series timothy olyphant played sheriff seth bullock and did a great job of portraying that feel of the old west . he looks like a cowboy , acts like i would stereotype a cowboy to act and was very personable.in , justified , mr. olyphant plays rayland givens , a us marshall stationed in kentucky . even though deadwood was set in the 1800s and justified is based in modern day , the & # 34 ; feel & # 34 ; of the show is similar . mr. olyphant plays a character that wears a 10-gallon cowboy hat and prefers to shoot ( with deadly accuracy ) by drawing his sidearm in old school & # 34 ; wild west style & # 34 ; shootouts.a well-written show with great characters . if you like westerns or law shows , check this one out !

> gravity is a pretty easy movie to sum up . beautiful visuals thanks to 100 % convincing cgi , great acting and a musical score that adds so much to what you are seeing . there is not too much of a story other than survival in space , though some character development emerges as the movie goes along . sandra bullock delivers a performance that should get her another oscar nomination . her acting here is very natural and believable . george clooney is likeable and a perfect contrast to bullock 's uptight and nervous character . i expect to see gravity up for multiple awards ( picture , director , actress , visuals effects and numerous other technical ones ) . sure it is more of a thrill ride than a structured movie , but it is unlike any movie i 've ever seen , especially in imax 3-d .

> i 've got 20+ windham hill cds in my collection , almost all of them from the golden 1980s era , when the windham hill label was at its peak of creative ( and commercial ) efforts . now that it 's december , and we 're getting into the holiday spirit , i find myself playing these albums again , none more so that this one . `` a winter 's solstice '' ( originally released in 1985 ; 9 tracks ; 40 min . ) brings an outstanding collection of `` christmas '' -themed/sounding music , and at the same time a fantastic time-capsule ( now 25+ years on ) of windham hill label all-stars . it starts with david qualey 's beautiful evocative `` jesu , joy of man 's desiring '' . label founder and guitarist will ackerman contributes a pensive `` new england morning '' . i love pianist philip aaberg 's contribution `` high plains ( christmas on the high line ) '' . but wait , there 's much more ! solo-pianist liz story `` greensleeves '' is just as good . and the all-stars keep coming : malcom dalglish 's solo-dulcimer track `` northomlrian lullabye '' might well be my favorite track on here . the last 2 tracks are equally fabulous : shadowfax 's `` petite arbade '' is beautifully understated , and the album closer is an equally understated , yet majestic 6 min . track from mark isham , `` tale of two cities '' .wow , what a collection . it remains the best of them all after all these years , period . there would come many sequels in what would become the `` winter 's solstice '' franchise , but none better than this album . later yet , there would be `` windham hill christmas '' releases but by then i had lost interest in the label . for another , competely untraditional christmas album release , check out also over the rhine 's 1996 release `` darkest night of the year '' , just mesmorizing , which has aged beautifully now 15 years on , as has the original `` a winter 's solstice '' release .

> i just love nora roberts books . again and again i am pleased with the books she writes . i particularly like her series books.this is the second book in this series about a family in ireland . i have to admit to being a little bit hesitant to reading books about ireland because many times the author will get sidetracked by faeries , goblins , and pots of gold . although nora roberts did a great job in the first book of this series , i was worried she would n't do so well this time . not to fear , she wrote with her usualy flair for romance and although there were some faery stuff , it was n't so much it took away from the story.nora 's love of ireland shines through in her writing . the descriptions of ireland make me feel that i could travel there and see exactly these places she describes.the characters are adorable . they are non traditional in that brenna is the hammer holding , jack of all trade type woman . she is one who can change the oil , take care of herself , and cook dinner . shawn is a musician . this book explores the changes that take place in relationships as friendship turns to love . it does a credible job of exploring the fears and concerns of the two main characters and those around the two characters.i particularly like how characters from past books in this series are reintroduced and you are able to follow their lives as well.what a wonderful , well written book .

> in & quot ; when the sleeper wakes & quot ; , h.g . wells departs from his previous occupation of writing novels based on fantasy and fabrication and turns to using the methods of science fiction and applying his projections of societal development to his stories.in making his projections of what the future was to be like , wells saw the enemy as monopolist/capitalist and portrayed them in the future as the great corporation.this was the evil of capitalism , which lead wells to conclude that the business states would take the place of what was 19th century governments.the flaw with this in the novel is that as a result of this new type of order , individuals are victims of the category of person that fate places them in . people are measured by their utility or lack of utility.wells ' vision is repulsive rather than desirable , and it is clear that he does n't believe in the ability of society to live up to its own ideals of equality and justice.we 've seen this played out on the world stage during the industrial revolution , which gave birth to the evils of communism . wells was a visionary , no doubt , but this story underestimates the human spirit and what happens when you combine democracy with capitalism !

> ironically , this book was suggested as a better alternative to rowling 's just released cuckoo under a pseudonym . so i thought i would give it a try . it is quite good and i read a lot of detective and police fiction . the title refers to a victim who is found splattered on the pavement of the chateau marmont after jumping from his seventh story window . or was it murder ? the victim 's father , a councilman , believes it was . so lapd detective harry bosch starts investigating but he is also interested in a cold case murder from twenty years ago . the two cases are not related but harry does investigate both . as i was reading this i found an absolutely wonderful poem about musician chet baker the author included . i would have read this book for the poem alone ! i have now begun the one written after this , the black box . i may work backwards on this series instead of starting with the first set in the early nineties . i am enjoying it . i had already read this author 's first book in the mickey series and liked that very well too ( the lincoln lawyer , also made into a terrific movie ) .

> this story , as grisham mentions at the end of the book , was not based on reality . it was , however , a very enjoyable yarn with many plot twists . to all future readers : do n't believe all the `` facts '' as the story enfolds . many things are not as they seem . do n't believe everything you read until you read the entire book and reach the conclusion . the story starts off with an inmate who figures out a way to cut his jail time in half , by `` helping '' the government convict someone for the murder of a federal judge . he does that and is released . then the real story begins.without telling any more of the story , let me say that the story was quite enjoyable , and could eventually be made into a movie . it was that good . i would recommend this book to anyone that likes grisham books .

> we go through earphones like candy in our house , at least once every few months someone is buying a new set . but this one ... this one is markedly better than the rest ( well , so it should be , look at the price ) i am not an audiophile , though my husband is , but even i could hear the difference . listen to a beloved piece ( i listened to rhapsody in blue ) and it just sounds amazing - so much clearer , like there are more notes , it 's significantly better than other earphones i 've used . my only ( small ) negative is that i did n't find the ear buds as comfortable as i would have liked , if you have very small ear holes the buds might feel too big . other than that , these are the best in ear headphones that i 've tried so far .
= significantly better sound
< great for the price

> these bags are the perfect size for a trash can we use in the garage . they hold a lot of trash and odd shaped items without tearing . i like the draw string tie to close it up and to use to carry it out.we also use these bags to gather up and save aluminum cans and plastic bottles for recycling and i like how you can stuff them full , load them into your own truck or car and not worry about them spilling.the diamond shaped pattern in the plastic bag lets them stretch around the trash and not tear . there are thicker bags available but these thinner ones with the forceflex design seem just as tough for our needs.a trash bag is a trash bag until you ca n't find a bag tie or they rip and spill all over the place . then you 'll wish you had used these !

> red velvet cupcake murder by joanne fluke is an interesting mystery set in lake eden , minnesota . # 16 in the `` hannah swensen mystery with recipes '' series , but can be read as a stand alone . filled with lively debates , mystery , and drama . while , i have not read all of this series , i believe you can only take a character so far before it is time to move on to another chapter in their life , this is the way of hannah swensen . although , it is well worth the time and expense for the delicious recipes at the end of each chapter . if you enjoy a cozy mystery , than you will enjoy this story . received for an honest review from the publisher.rating : 3heat rating : sweetreviewed by : aprilr , review courtesy of my book addiction and more

> i have to admit that i expected italy , art , lots of biblical references , diabolical plots by the catholic church and some similar to the angels and demons.notinferno has been one of the books i 've most enjoyed lately , with it 's lessons on art and poetry ; it 's modern plot twists and the back stories to the characters that made it thoroughly enjoyable . good enough that when the final twist is revealed , you 'll be going & # 34 ; no & # 34 ; . great read ...

> i first played minecraft at my cousins house last saturday night ( xbox 360 version ) and immediately fell in love with it . i was already thinking about getting the pocket edition since i had heard so much good things about it and half of the people in my class had started a newsletter called minecraft weekly . so the next day i downloaded the game and it is n't quite as good as the xbox 360 version but it is very good . recommend it to everyone !

> a fascinating story , very graphical . on a first couple of chapter i thought of reading it with my kids ( 9 & 12 ) , but further down in the book i changed my mind on that , it 's not for kids under 13. it 's an interesting read , but slow at times , the ending was a bit of a disappointment for me , but overall this book definitely left an impression on me .

> col. mickey marcus ( kirk douglas ) had just returned home from wwii when david ben-gurion and the fledgling jewish freedom fighters asked him to come to palestine to organize their forces into a real army . although he had a wife ( angie dickinson ) at home , marcus missed the excitement and agreed to help . as the palmach , haganah , and other underground groups join forces to fight the arabs bent on their destruction , mickey becomes the first general of the new israeli army.this movie has many similarities to 1960 's `` exodus , '' but is n't as successful . douglas ' colonel marcus is such a jovial , sarcastic , and & uuml ; ber-confident charmer that he just does n't seem to take the war seriously and makes it look like a walk in the park . mickey 's non-stop wisecracks left me wishing he would cut it out and just talk normally . the requisite battlefield love story with freedom fighter senta berger is too predictable and she does n't have much range as an actress . casting john wayne , frank sinatra , and yul brynner does n't help matters either ; they look out of place and distract from the story , although wayne is likable as an american general who locks horns with mickey and gradually comes to respect him . topol plays the only arab with a speaking part as a bumbling buffoon.partially filmed in israel , the location does help to show the difficulties faced by the army . we see several battles that mickey actually commanded ; there are explosions and a lot of gunfire , but they are sanitized to the point of being virtually bloodless . col. marcus was certainly an important and heroic man but this movie does n't do him justice . 2.5 stars .

> well i read some of the reviews and purchaced the sennheiser rs 120 .they came on friday and i unpacked them and the set up was straight forward . its pretty hard to make a mistake . just make sure you put the batteries in correctly . i hooked it up to my direct tv to the sound out i turned it on and it worked great . i walked around my property and range was great . the directions said to charge the batteries for eighteen hours so put it on the charger and did just that . the next day was the sebring 12 hour race and i am hard of hearing so put them on at 7am and listened till 9:00am took a two hour break and the race came back on at 11:00sm so they were on form 11:00am till 7:45pm and the batteries were still working fine . so they lasted in excess of my expectations . ten and a half hours and still going strong . when i turned the unit on in the morning i had some of the hiss that i read about so i changed channels and the third channel was nice and clear problem solved . also after wearing them all day my ears did not hurt and that was a surprise . they do not fit me real tight but tight enough . they are made nice . i am a happy customer . one thing that seemed confusing to me is it dosent tell you witch way to set them on the charger . so i put them on so you can read the name sennheiser on the top form the front . seems to charge fine that way . im very pleased

> i got this from our library , after having looked longingly at it several summers in a row as we visited national parks . i 'm glad i did n't buy it - the photographs of the parks in the book are lovely , but there are not nearly enough of them . instead , most of the photographs are of people and the historical parks.the text in the book is too predictably anti-american . as in , the parks are america 's national parks , but ideally , regular americans would be kept out of them more often ( or restricted to certain areas ) so that the parks could be places of solitude for people who really understand . oh . really ? this book 's text is filled with contempt for the people who rightly protest against ideas like introducing wild predators in areas that border ranches , or seizing property for the parks despite the fact that the property is owned by someone else , or placing rich mineral deposits completely off-limits by designating national park status ... how silly of those people . do n't they know that their government knows what is best for them ? i have never seen the documentary that ken burns made , but this book probably follows it closely . they would have done much better to publish a book of spectacular color photographs and skip the predictably anti-human blah blah blah . if you want that stuff , you can read practically any guidebook published ( fodor 's , frommer 's , especially lonely planet ... )
= not enough color photographs

> i 'll admit , i was no frampton fan when this came out . the songs were inescapable , always on the radio , frampton seemed to be just another `` pretty boy '' who seemed to have chops but was overshadowed by image , and it was too much the `` thing to buy . `` well , i do n't know if i 've changed all my opinions about his work but i have to admit the guy owns this crowd . even a trifle like `` penny for your thoughts '' is met with an enthusiasm that can only be earned by the power of performance ; frampton is a sensation live , making the crowd a part of the show in a way that only a truly gifted performer can . this ability carries over into the recording where he seems to be energized by the crowd ; taking their enthusiasm and using it to push his way through the rather mediocre material that he presents . the songs are not masterpieces ; as other reviewers have noted , his studio recordings were never works of art , but playing live at least on this recording , elevates these songs to a higher level . frampton has never really done anything to approach the impact of this recording but frampton comes alive is definitely one worth having , not just as piece of nostalgia but as a representation of how a concert should be captured for posterity .

> amazing ! scriptured based , which is always an excellent base . with this foundation , you can never go wrong . you will learn so much , make sure you have your bible handy , mark your passages so you can come back to them time and time again for easy reference.what it all boils down to is , god sent his son to die for our sins . he forgives us , so we should forgive others . if he can forgive our sins , we can forgive others . how could we not ? for if you forgive others for their transgressions , your heavenly father will also forgive you . but if you do not forgive others , then your father will not forgive you your transgressions . matthew 6:14-15a great book to have on the shelf , for personal reference , or if you ever need to help someone else . i really think the one topic that stuck out to me was , well it is n't as important to forgive the other person simply because it is what you should do , but it can hinder your relationship with god most importantly and taint others as well.read this , you wo n't be sorry , and your relationships with god and others will be blessed as well !

> i have been a tv watcher for over 50 years and i can honestly state breaking bad is one of the greatest television series i have ever had the pleasure to watch . since its first episode , i was glued to my screen and several of the episodes i watched more than once . in the final season , the story becomes very intense , up to the climactic ending scene . every bit of it is great acting , attested to by the many awards the show and bryan cranston has received . now , this is n't everyone 's cup of tea . the show is very intense , violent and heart wrenching at times . i feel very connected to the characters from real people i have met in my life.unlike some cable and television series that peter out after a couple seasons yet insist on dragging on for a few more , the final season of breaking bad is more compelling , to me , than the first . every episode ends in a cliffhanger and it would be easy to be lured into watching all of it in a marathon weekend .

> tom hanks is the grown-up man with the 13-year-old mind . as aboy he makes a wish in front of a carnival fortune-telling machine to be big , and his wish is granted ( physically but not mentally ) . he goes on a search to find the machine to change the wish ; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company . basically the movie then becomes one long joke about a `` child '' in the adult world , but it tends toward other issues , too - the loss of innocence and that surface honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears in adulthood . hanks , of course , is a hit at the toy company ( what 13 year old would n't be ? ) . but he falls in love with a co-worker , which makes the decision to go back to 13 again at the end more heartrending . hanks is very good in this child 's role . worth a watch .

> this is a great read.i picked up on the oval office reference but just put that one down as a good way to say they were in the president 's office as many readers probably think the actual oval office has always been there . i have recently read team of rivals , lincoln , manhunt and lincoln at war . all of these books probably had something out of place also . oreilly and his co-author did a great job telling this story . i was a kid in dallas on november 22 , 1963 and went to dealey plaza the weekend of the assasination of jfk . i still remember my shock . this book does a fantastic job of relating that similiar shock that was among the people when lincoln died.even non-history nuts will enjoy the book as it reads like a tv script . i would say ... go buy it . you learn a lot and have a good read . well done !

> having finally moved to a house that would give me an opportunity to see a wide variety of birds ; i thought a guide would be useful . not being an avid birdwatcher i thought the audobon society would be the place to look , but i found this guide to be just ok. separating the photos from the descriptions is more than a little annoying , and the photos themselves only show one angle so identification for the novice is often dependent upon seeing the bird from the correct angle . while fairly comprehensive and not without its uses ; i will look elsewhere for a guide that better suits the needs of the novice birdwatcher .

> i 'm sure we ca n't wait till september and the release of the first season of magnum on dvd . i for one pre-ordered it here at amazon since forty-one dollars and ninety-nine cents for a whole season of magnum is a steal . the shipping was even free . i hope it is not to late for the person that paid two hundred to stop their order for a transfer of vhs tapes of the show to dvd . this is by far one of the best detective series or overall television series i have seen . this is a show that you never get tired of seeing over and over . the cast and stories made it very watchable . add in the gorgeous hawaiin scenery and it could n't be beat . someday i hope that we may see simon and simon on dvd as well.this set 's picture quality is excellent . seeing this on a high definition tv is incredible . the splendid views of hawaii will make those who have visited it reminisce . my only complaint about this first set is that mike post 's theme song is only played at the menu screen and at the end of the episodes beginning with the 7th episode . the original music played the first season was to brash and clashed with the events on screen . the music improves after this first season . the stories are entertaining and it gives us a good look how this popular series develops the characters . this is an excellent set for anyone that enjoyed the series or people that enjoy detective series .

> rev . clare fergusson is called out to help search for a missing woman , whose family land is about to be sold that evening for a resort . some would call that avoidance -- and they 'd be right . clare 's bishop is coming for a visit the next day . just before that , the bishop 's deacon and 'fixer ' arrives to discuss some problems the arch diocese is having with clare.as the search progresses , clare is thrown more and more into the company of the town 's very married police chief , russ van alstyne . the pair 's relationship is already causing some talk , but the two are doing their best to keep everything above-board despite their feelings for each other.meanwhile , several subplots are evolving as a newly unemployed logger angrily assaults a lumber mill owner 's daughter and his wife tries to cover it up . also , a mill owner discovers someone who might just change his fate -- if he plays his cards right ... the book is very intense , but i did n't find it as compelling as the others in this series . it is still a very worthwhile read and is definitely needed before `` all mortal flesh . ''
= not the best of the series , but a good bridge

> i had been using the suave moroccan infusion - shine and loved it but i had just got my hair colored so i decided to try the color care from the moroccan infusion line.the color care has that same nice spicy scent that the rest of the suave moroccan infusion products do . it 's the kind of scent that you would expect with a moroccan infusion . they 've done a really nice job with the scent because with me , spicy scents can go either way but i love this one . the scent really seems to linger too . i catch my husband sniffing my hair.the conditioner really softens my hair . i use the suave moroccan styling oil too but my hair is so incredibly soft after just the conditioner that i probably do n't even need it.my hair looks so great with the products from the moroccan infusion line that i 've never had better results with anything else i 've ever used . i am pawning off all my other hair products on my other family members because i do n't want to use anything else .
= love the whole line !
< nice scent , nice scent

> for someone who was looking for something that was simple , and easy to use at the gym , this little gadget is nothing short of perfect . it is very easy to put the music on it that you want with media player , and very easy to use . this mp3 player is very light , and has great sound quality.i read one of the reviews that said the head phones that came with it were too big , but i did not find this to be a problem at all . for the price , and with all the great features that this comes with , it is a very hard to beat product . i am only in the gym for about an hour at a time , so no real problems with the battery life . the only thing i wish this little thing did was to send or have the capability to have an fm transmitter to use it in your car . other than that , perfect little product .
= great little device !
< great for the price

> the film 's obvious influences are `` escape from new york '' and `` die hard '' . if you 're not paying attention maggie grace pretty much reprises her role in `` taken '' as the president 's hostage daughter . regardless , `` lockout '' has a certain ragged charm of its own almost cormanesque . despite the similarities to other films it has rhythms all of its own . i think a lot of that can be attributed to the presence of guy pearce in the lead role of snow , a wrongfully disgraced cia agent in the year 2079. pearce seems like the most unlikeliest of action heroes but on sheer attitude he pulls it off . snow is as quick with a quip as he is with a gun . he could go toe-to-toe with john mcclane in the wisecrack department . if you 're looking for pure escapist entertainment with a little grist `` lockout '' is the film for you .
= inspired by an idea by luc besson ... right

> holy guacamole , that was one emotional roller coaster of a book . i have n't read a book that tugged at my heartstrings as much as this book did in a very long time . for as much as this book elicited feelings of joy , it also brought me to tears , and not the classy single tear rolling down the cheek cry , but a full blown embarrassingly messy cry.i went into this book with not-so-high hopes since i was n't crazy about looking for alaska , but i have to say that all my expectations were beyond exceeded . green 's writing was consistent . the plot was perfect . the characters were real . if you know anything about my style in books , it 's that these three things really make me tick . green absolutely nailed it and i ca n't express how glad i am that i gave his writing a second chance .
= completely worth the five star rating ! !
< green 's guacamole

> i bought the scale because i was frustrated with the different readings i was getting on my other one ( if you stepped off and on , it would change by as much as 4 lbs ) . here 's what i like about this scale : you can get on & off several times and you will get the exact same reading ! ! , the wt on the scale matched my md 's scale exactly when i came home & compared , and you will get a wt to the nearest 0.2 , so you can see a 1/2 pound wt loss ! for those who need to know this , it also has an upper wt limit of 400 lbs- much higher than most other scales . i believe this scale is accurate & reliable , and a helpful adjunct to a wt loss program ( because of the 0.2 increments ) - so i highly recommend !
= very happy with this scale !
< great scale !

> the defender case on the phone is very protective . i like it . what i do n't like is that the belt clip ( holster ) falls off my belt when i bend over . my wife 's otterbox defender was clipped to the pocket of her purse . when she answered her phone , she did n't realize the belt clip had fallen off . the phone store told us to contact otterbox customer service to get a new clip . otterbox would only send a new clip if we could send them a picture of the old clip , which of course was missing . otterbox customer service is horrible . automated replies to emails that did n't solve the problem and otterbox made no attempt to provide a new clip . we never did get a new clip - purchased a different brand of phone case . i would not purchase an otterbox again .
= otterbox customer service is horrible - i do not recommend

> i am addicted to these candies . they have a somewhat hard , but still chewable outer shell and a wonderfully sweet jelly filled center . the fruit flavors are strong and last throughout the short life of the candy.they 're expensive for what you get , but like i said , i 'm addicted.i wish i could buy the flavors ala carte , in which case , i would buy very little if any of the lemon , which is my least favorite.since my grandchildren discovered these on the kitchen counter , my supplies diminish all the quicker.judging from my own experience , a lot of people wo n't like these candies . they have a very intense taste and the jelly filling can stick to your teeth for a moment or two until you swish it away with your tongue.but then there are the people like me who could eat them all the time.jerry

> the father of the boy wrote the book , and it lost a little in translation . however , there was enough information told from the son 's experience to align biblical teaching with the experience the boy had during his coma . i have listened to friends discuss their own out of body experience during heart problems or other medical emergencies that also are very similiar to heaven is for real , and proof of heaven by eben alexander . the two books i read in tandem , and i urge others to do the same . i chose heaven is for real first , and proof of heaven second , which gave a very good scientific evidence . both books aligned with my study of the bible , and i could not find contridictions to religious teaching in either book , which gave credibilities to these accounts .

> this looked like a great design , but after a few days of use i noticed an alcoholic smell . there was black gunk where the lid screws in , hard to reach . soaked it in bleach and that was ok , but after using it more , and trying to clean inside the lid under that contraption , i decided to try soaking it in vinegar . after a day , i still noticed some gunk in the lid . so i took it to a waterpik.and there was a lot of black gunk coming out of that lid.i appreciate all the cleaning tips , but even with a waterpik i 'm not sure i 'm getting all of it , since i ca n't see under that lid thingy . i 'm looking to return this.on the plus side , it 's pretty leakproof .
= hard to clean

> sort of an `` oh , god '' movie ... it is surprising to find jenifer aniston andand jim carey in a film about god ( even a comedy ) .casting here is a real issue : god is black and sarcasticand the two leading characters ( actors ) are just not modelsof moral integrity in their own lives are they ? so this movie might be said to be making a point for the islamicside of modern ideology ? much of the humor is pretty nasty as well ( toilet humor with a dog ) .the writers probably complain they did n't get paid enough for this , too ! it is no wonder that translated bollywood is better than this ... do you really think most people pray about winning lotto tickets ?
= morgan freeman as george burns ?
< a real issue

> i 've not read the book , however , based upon other reviews it seems the book is likely a good read and well written . unfortunately , the hollywood crowd seems to have gotten their hands on the this television version of `` under the dome '' and it shows bad . someone has taken a excellent idea and ruined it in only 4 episodes with ever increasing excessive drama that is completely not necessary . the drama and political correctness agenda stinks in the television script writing to high heaven . had this show come out in the 70 's or 80 's it would have been amazing . modern rubbish writing tainted with agenda ruined it for me already , only four episodes into it .
= started out great but is quickly nose diving into excessive drama
< not as good as the book

> this flashlight is identical to several other flashlights sold under different names on amazon , so it 's a matter of finding the one with the lowest price . they 're shipped from china , so delivery takes about four weeks . with a single aa battery , this thing puts out a remarkably intense beam of light , even on the widest zoom setting . the jet-black machined aluminum housing is solid as a rock , and it looks super . weighing only 3.1 ounces ( including the battery ) and only 3 & # 34 ; in length , it wo n't be a burden in your pocket or bag . overall , for the price , this is a great little flashlight .
= a lot of light in a very small package

> i 've heard about this must-have twenty-nine track compilation of the ventures from a couple of long time patrons . basically , your proto-type standard surf magic here to thoroughly take in . believe me , those new / er surf bands that came onto the scene later has nothing on the ventures . tunes that i found myself playing repeatedly were `` ram-bunk-shush '' , `` driving guitars ( ventures twist ) '' , the unmatchable instrumentals - `` underground fire '' and their best known gem `` hawaii five-o '' as well as the all too familiar sounding `` night drive '' and the ( almost ) unreal `` fugitive '' . highly recommended .

> the history of burma or myanmar is romantic and interesting . author ghosh blends the indian experience in burma with the history of supayalat and the fate of burmese royalty up to the rising opposition party of aung san suu kyi . against this backdrop , ghosh creates some interesting characters , notably a young indian orphan who rises to become a teak tycoon . rajkumar 's story is the centerpoint of the book , against which the end of the british raj and the tragedy of the japanese invasion of world war ii are played out.if you like michener , you will like the scope and character of this novel .

> i 've used a few mueller products for my back and legs , and have always been pleased with their performance and quality . this is no exception . it is very effective in immobilizing my wrist but still allows for finger movement/usage . the overall build quality is more than decent considering the price . the velcro straps allow for proper positioning and a good fit regardless of your wrist size.i use it on my right hand , but the design is such that it can be used on either hand.it makes a big difference in allowing my wrist to heal after an injury . very highly recommend .

> i 've heard about how great the music was & i must say i feel a bit differently about that ! ! i cried all the way through this movie & the music helped turn me into tears even before she began to sing ! ! i 'm not saying the song is awful but if you have had a hurt in your life that you 've never gotten over this movie will effect you as it did me ! ! do n't watch it with p.m.s . either ! !

> our only complaint is the expected maintenance on it . they want you to completely switch out the water daily and once a week do a vinegar bath for it . we certainly have not achieved that level of maintenance ( we have lives ) , but no ill-effects so far . we leave it on all day/night and we need to re-fill it on a daily basis . it is fairly easy to refill , so we really have no complaints other than the recommended maintenance .

> when twc indicated they were going to start charging rent on their modems , i check out the cost/benefit of purchasing . this model was one of several listed by twc as working with their cable and it had an eleven month payback , which i have already received several months ago . fairly easy to install if you have messed around with this stuff , and no problems at all .
= recommended by time warner cable
< works great

> the most interesting portions of this book were not the author 's near death experience , but the sections where his doctors and family were dealing with his quickly deteriorating medical condition . the writing is crisp and clear , but the sections on his other-worldly experience seemed pretty uninteresting , and offer nothing new . still , it 's a quick read if you are interested .
= life story better
< not the author 's near death experience

> author has created a fantastic book with great illustrations and culture introductions beginning with mexico 's country maps , popular names , tourist spots , national holiday , with children as the main focus . street food/pronunciations are also included . excellent for elementary school kids and addition to school book list.i was provided a ebook for review in exchange of a honest and fair review .

> after nearly 16 years of single handedly raising her sister 's child , marnie gets a surprise visit from the unknowing birth father , a famous astronaut who bedded down her then 16 year old sister sharon ( he was 23 ) and produced david . sharon died when david was 4. apparently someone has been sending letters about david to law , and he is there to put a stop to the potential career-ending rumors . his first reaction upon meeting marnie ? he does not recall sleeping with her.when confronted with david , the similarity between the two is striking ; david is the spitting image of law . law insists on a blood test , but already has lost his heart to his son and his adoptive mother . unknown to him , she has carried a torch for him since she was 14. he tries to worm his way into her heart ( okay , really just her bed ) , while she tries to hold him at arm 's length . marnie allows david to move in with law temporarily to allow them to get to know each other . but will he choose all the gadgets and possessions law can provide verses the love he has had the last 16 years ? the fact that law constantly pressures marnie into an intimate relationship is somewhat comical . he refers to the birth mother of his child as a slut ( sharon was a 16 year old virgin when he met her , fed her alcohol , skinny dipped with her , then deflowered her ) , yet marnie is matronly because she will not engage in the same reckless behavior ... take this for what it is - a very dated melodramatic romance novel with a very alpha male that does not really translate well in this decade , but was interesting nonetheless . i really liked the relationship between marnie and david .
= astronaut discovers he fathered a child with virginal teen `` slut ''
< dated melodramatic romance

> my husband and i are in our 60s and never had a smart phone or case until now . with the price of the samsung s4 , we thought protection was a good thing , so bought a spigen case and tech armor for the screen . after reading all the reviews , i was a little leery of putting the protective film in place but worry was for nothing . for those youngsters out there , who are not familiar with contact paper , installing this is the same thing . hands need to be clean , surface needs to be clean . peel back a 1 '' portion using the very handy tab ( contact paper is not equipped with this ! ) and align the top edge with the top edge of the phone face . it 's got enough stiffness to it that it does n't want to bend or fold or stick to itself . this was way easier than even putting tape on a package ! you can tell we 're normally low tech in this house . it went on easy ! had a couple air bubbles but slid them off to the side and out . one thing i would suggest , if you are putting some type of case on the phone at the same time , i would do the protective film first and then the case . reversing that order might make things a little more difficult . anyway , the tech armor comes with very detailed instructions and even a video ( which i did n't use ) . all of the swiping mechanisms are just the same although the feel is a tad bit different , probably because of the glare free element of this specific product . very happy with the product and helps us feel we are doing our best to take care of this expensive new toy !
= first smart phone , first protective product
< great product !

> there are flaws in this book , but for me , the high points far outweigh the low ones.in the 40 's , newspaper reporter heroes were common , one of the most popular being george harmon coxe 's flashgun casey , but as mysteries became more realistic , reporters no longer made plausible as investigators . connelly justifies his reporter character by having him practically forced into being part of the investigation . jack mcevoy is indeed in a complicated situation in that he on one hand is a reporter right on top of an important story , and on the other hand , is one victim 's brother and therefore motivated to do the right thing by his brother.at one point , i suddenly did n't like him because he performed what i consider an inconscienable act for purposes of embellishing the story he 'll eventually write ; but he later has second thoughts and feelings and realizes the sorrow his action would cause , so that he replaces that which he took before the act is discovered . this was an illustration of his struggle between being a top reporter and being a good brother.the revelation of the poet 's identity threw me and disturbed me at first , but after analyzing it , i saw what he was saying . however , the message was somehow garbled and that 's why i 'm not giving it 5 stars . however , i do advise all readers to watch that ending carefully so that you catch the writer 's intent . otherwise , you might like many of the reviewers think it a very unbelievable ending.finally , i warn more sensitive readers that this is indeed strong stuff . we see a very disgusting killer 's mind in operation , and it 's not a pleasant view we get .

> we also have a nexus 7 and the hdx is a nice complement but my gripe is with the amazon app store . apps do n't update in a timely manner and too many are not available for my hdx . i find we get most of our apps from google play for the nexus so i wind up using that tab more than the hdx . loosen up the control amazon.we use the hdx for reading mostly ... .it is great for that since we prefer a 7 & # 34 ; to 6 & # 34 ; for a reader . there is just not enough text per page for the small readers to suit us . we downloaded a few games from the daily free apps but we do n't watch much video on a tab ... .or on tv . today 's movies are just not made for people in their 70s ... yes , my husband and i are old and cranky but we love to read . the tv is just that , a tv . i do n't want the tv to be my tablet or tablet to be my tv . plain tv and plain tablet suit us just fine.i bought this on the payment plan and since i bought a 50 buck or more card just about every month anyway , this plan fit my budget perfectly .

> there 's nothing i can say that has not been said in other reviews . everyone comments that the mount is really good because i use it on a rattling diesel truck , the chassis vibrates a lot . despite the copious amounts of vibration the mount has held on strong , securely holding a s3 . as an experiment , i tried pulling the mount off without using the release tab and ended up pulling off a section of the dashboard ( haha ) . it made it easier to access the wiring for the headunit.i could mount it to the windshield , but i had a spot on the dash that was flat and pretty smooth to stick it on and it holds to its spot like a champ.pros- mount holds on strong despite the vibrations- the position of the arm/rotation stays securely in place and does n't come loose from vibrations- strong enough to pull off the dashboard if the dashboard is held in place only with clips ( makes for a good tool to pull the dashboard off to get access to the headunit or wiring in the dash , haha ) con- none that i know of

> do you often complicate things so much that achieving your most important goals becomes difficult , if not impossible ? do your viewpoints and attitudes about how the world works get in the way of your success ? do seemingly impenetrable barriers inhibit your progress ? do these obstacles have a negative impact on your thinking , self-confidence and ability to keep moving ? are you going in circles ? if so , mark joyner has some ideas on how to get out of that stultifying rut . in his new book , joyner shows you how to break out of the prison of your mind and start seeing things more clearly . most importantly , he explains how to get precisely what you want . joyner 's book is a bit disjointed , and perhaps its practical application is not as simple as the author proposes , though the additional materials on his free web site help . nevertheless , joyner is an original and eclectic thinker , and we find many of his concepts interesting and enlightening . hopefully , they will enable you to move ahead more directly and get where you want to be .

> `` modigliani '' ( 2004 ) is a self-indulgent , pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist . writer-director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work . ironically , the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani . despite his boundless enthusiasm , andy garcia is simply too old for the title role . an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate .

> this is a compact way to add 4 usb 3.0 ports to a pc or laptop with zero fuss . it & # 8217 ; s fully plug and play ( tested on win 7 and xp machines ) . the hub itself is very compact , measuring only about 3.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide . all four ports are on the long edge of the hub.a nice feature , and a feature not usually found in a hub , is on/off switches for each port . each switch works independently , so you can turn on ( or off ) just the ports you want to use . that & # 8217 ; s handy for when i & # 8217 ; m using the hub as a charge port and want to turn off the power without having to disconnect the device . the switches each have a light to indicate if it is powered on . the switch itself is rather light-duty feeling , but so far none have failed to work.the cord that plugs into the pc is short ( less than a foot end-to-end ) but is stout and has well-anchored connectors . the short length makes it more suitable to something such as a laptop ( easy to carry along ) rather than a floor-mounted pc.zero problems with usage or functionality . keep in mind this is a passive hub ( it draws its power from the pc rather than a separate power supply ) so it & # 8217 ; s not well-suited to power-hungry attachments , such as large external drives . it works great for thumb drives , printers , and other such devices.works as it should and the separate power buttons for each port is a great feature . my only concern is the light duty feel of the switches . i 'll update the review should that become a problem .

> i do n't feel good giving this only 3 stars , but i have to admit to myself that i really do n't enjoy this album very much . i 'm a huge fan of 60s & 70s soul music and love discovering other artists from that wonderful period of music history . i had read about solomon burke for many years , both in peter guralinick 's `` sweet soul music '' book and various magazine and newspaper articles . seemed like a singer i would really dig . i tried the double cd set `` home in your heart '' about a decade ago and could n't quite understand what all the fuss was about . i ended up selling that one , but i got curious again and bought this single disc collection recently . well , i 'm still not that impressed . solomon 's got a great voice , but the songs he recorded here simply do n't strike me as soul classics . is this b-league soul music ? i know that some of his fans will rake me over the coals for such a statement , but to my ears his songs do n't even come close to the quality of magical ones recorded by the likes of otis redding , marvin gaye , al green , smokey robinson , and other singers from the same era . honestly , i think solomon got better at picking songs to sing later in his career . albums from the past decade or so , such as `` do n't give up on me '' sound great to me . maybe this older 60s material is too dated . but i think if the songs were stronger , that would n't matter so much . whatever the case , something 's missing from the `` wow factor .

> where in the world is george michael nowadays ? who knows ? his last album , the cover cd `` songs from the last century '' tanked mightily and his last proper album before that , `` older '' , is by now 6 years old ... so while we wait for george to wake up and smell the coffee , we have this 1998 sprawling ( 2 cds , 140 min ) `` best of '' to remember what george was/is capable of.the compilation is divided in `` from the heart '' ( cd1 , read : the ballads ) and `` for the feet '' ( cd2 , read : the dance tunes ) . nobody is going to question his genius for writing great songs , and they are all here : careless whisper , freedom , too funky , kissing a fool , faith , heal the pain , cowboys and angels , monkey , waiting for that day , and go on and on . marvelous ! here is the problem : there are simply too many filler songs on this compliation ( such as desafinado , you have been loved , a moment with you , spinning the wheel , etc . ) what would have worked better is a single cd , compiling all his greatest hits , no more , no less . another beef i have is that one of his greatest hits , `` i want your sex '' , appears here as `` part 2 '' , which is radically different from the song we all know and remember . what is up with that ? so what could 've , should 've been a compliation of george michael 's greatest hits , is n't ... not that this compilation is bad , but it could 've been greater .

> quigley 's book acknowledges a major usage of php . to write some kind of front end user interface program that hooks to a back end mysql database . both are free and open source , and the combination has proved popular . especially where the front end involves making an html web page with embedded php commands.not every example involves both php and mysql . though all examples have php . many demonstrate how to use php inside an html file . like writing user-defined functions , or nesting functions . or making or using function libraries . the functions are a key idea in php , that take you beyond the elementary syntax . functions also let you gainfully use code by other php programmers . important if you are part of a coding group that has to divide up the programming effort in some manner.actually , the book has a serious drawback . despite the use of mysql in the title , it is only relatively late in the book that you encounter mysql . chapters 13 and 14 give a quick guide to mysql , as a standalone entity . out of 17 chapters , it is only chapters 15-17 that involve both php and mysql . perhaps the book should have a more extended discussion . to this ends , maybe some of the earlier chapters could have been shortened or dropped . because the reader is getting a book mostly on pure php . i suggest that given the very title , it is a reasonable expectation of most readers that the book will devote most of its attention to both subjects . especially when there is `` and '' in the title . readers are programmers , and the `` and '' has a very precise meaning to them .

> this takes up where the original hunger games left off . at the end of the last games , catniss thumbed her nose at the sadistic power structure - something that president snow took in a very personal way . that act of defiance ( it looked more like survival at the time , but became a symbol of defiance ) ignited something in the vast underclass , something that snow needs to extinguish at any cost ... the first movie came across as teen power fantasy , thinly coated with chaste romance . personalities get stronger in this one , like the quiet bravery of catniss 's sister , in her determination to support caniss . even the populace takes on a personality - wronged , hurt , looking for something better , and so bad off already that nothing can be worse . effie , that outrageously costumed media figure , best known for being well known ( sound familiar ? ) sees something too , in her pitiful attempts to ride catniss 's coat-tails . her neediness becomes palpable in the `` we 're a team , right ? '' moments . even snow 's grand-daughter , a ten-ish girl innocently following pop trends , takes on a deeper meaning when catniss is the trend.saying more would say too much , but there 's something much bigger and deeper under way , something that does n't become apparent until late in the story . it 's does n't give anything away to say that catniss prevails , and on her own terms , and in a way that makes a sequel not just inevitable but necessary . i 'm looking forward to it already. -- wiredweird

> there are two schools of reviewers in regard to this book . one believes that it is highly valuable , useful guide which will make us all wiser in our e-mailing . the second believes it is simplistic , commonsensical , and made for those who do not know that one and one is less than three.i have a slightly different take , somewhere between the two.i myself have been using e-mail for about seven years but am still a neophyte . i do not send group - messages , not only because i have never learned how but because i believe people should be if possible addressed one at a time.by the way one of the major elements of this book is teaching e-mail etiquette , teaching us to use people 's proper names , to not gratuitously insult and irritate by sending them offensive jokes or messages the length of 'war and peace ' . the book tries to teach us how to avoid causing superfluous crises in our relations with others , and gives examples of e-mail gaffes which have been very costly.it also sings the praises of e-mail , talks about its efficiency , its convenience , the circumstances where it is the preferred form of communication.its two major principles are : `` think before you send '' and `` send e-mail you would like to receive . '' it also provides interesting thoughts on other aspects of the whole 'mailing ' question for instance a list on where it is better to use snail mail rather than e-mail.i believe most e-mailers will be able to find something of use in this book .

> the starts out with the perfect family moving onto a posh community . their home is perfect and they have all the high tech gadgets to the envy of all their neighbors . however you start to realize not everything is normal behind the scenes as the parents sleep in separate bedrooms . when the daughter sneaks into her dad 's bedroom ( brief nudity ) mom has to drag her out.the `` secret '' we find out about 20 minutes into the movie is that this family is a plant and not really a family . their job is to make friends with everyone and show off the products so others will buy them . their success is measured by how much luxury stuff their neighbor 's buy to keep up with them . the real story comes as their perfect world unravels during a music montage as their own life gets in the way of their facade.the acting is good with strong performances by all the main characters . today , computer companies do this type of thing by placing a shill in someplace like starbucks pretending to be a regular guy when they are actually trying to soft sell a laptop.the movie is amusing , but not laugh out loud funny . it is heart warming , but does n't make you cry . it moves along at a good pace . a good one to have in your collection .

> guess who was one of these bands that hardly will be capable to forget today or ever . really they kenw to blend the essential harmony lines with adequate balance between the cantabile the chords and the use of electric guitars , droms and bass without creating aural fatigue in the listener .but in the other hand , they created songs loaded of innovativeness and creativity hard to believe . undun for example is a disturbing ballade , laughing is a charm ballade which trsnforms in a delightful and easy follw song .these eyes is their best song . perfect harmonies which mix a potent message and superb musical inspiration.share the land is a triumph song .no sugar tonight is a magnificent example how you can win with a song based in the bass .american woman does not need any other adjective , it was their battlehorse and his meeting card for new listeners in the neat generations .no time is one of my timeless favorite themes . there is a inner fire and sense of dynamism so difficult to find in similar bands of that age .just imagine about the guess who could have done in these times with the video techonologies and other mass media supports .acquire this album . and you will be engaged inmediatly .

> this is an amazingly good book . i echo the other reviewers who state that you do n't want to start this novel until you have a good chunk of time to sit down and read this book.the main characters are amazing , interesting and fascinating . they are flawed and it only adds to the storyline.brenna spector the main character is able to remember everything , except for the moment she last saw her sister . this helps her as she does her detective work solving crimes.in this story she has been asked to discover the truth about a young girl that vanashed many years before . iris neff walked away from a bar-b-que and was never seen again . now brenna must pull all the pieces together from long ago stories , current missing persons and find out the truth and the connections . during this book she often pulls in the side story of her sister going missing and i expected that in some way that would be solved but it was n't . it was just one more way she could relate to the other characters in this novel.i can hardly wait to read another book by this author . she is one of my new favorite authors.enjoy .

> in this wonderful autobiography , stormin ' norman schwarzkopf tells the story of his life . beginning with his early life during world war 2 , the story then goes on through his experiences with his father in pre-revolutionary persia , his time in the army , and culminates with his smashing success in operations desert shield and desert storm.this is an excellent autobiography , one of the best that i have read in a long time . it takes general schwarzkopf 's experiences , and combines them into an interesting and entertaining story . indeed , it 's not just his combat experiences that are interestingly written , but even his experiences in taking care of his men during peacetime interested me.i think that this book does a great job of telling you what general schwarzkopf saw and did , and also does a great job of telling you what kind of man he was and is . if you are at all interested in the modern united states army , or are interested in the man in charge of operation desert storm , then get this book - you will not be disappointed . i highly recommend this book !

> i think amazon is trying to create a class of products which give the consumer a reliable product to compete against similar brand name products at a lower price . trader joe 's , for comparison , has attracted more and more of my food dollar by creating its own named products which come in at a lower price than those it used to carry by a competitor . amazon is not yet as successful in following this plan as trader joe 's has been . first , this is not as fast a flash memory card as others out on the market , as already pointed out by another amazon reviewer , who did his own testing of various cards . second , the price really is n't that great of a reduction . i 'm frankly surprised that amazon does n't use these `` house '' products for awhile at a loss leader price to attract more consumers long range . in sum , a good overall idea which needs better overall execution .

> in 2004 director edgar wright and stars simon pegg and nick frost collaborated on `` shaun of the dead '' , a fresh and funny take on the zombie genre . `` the world 's end '' seems like a redux of `` shaun '' with androids substituting for zombies . this is n't to say that this film is n't without its moments but the element of surprise that was crucial to the previous film 's success is lacking here . wright and pegg have crafted a script with a lot of funny lines but probably should have ditched the android angle . the first third of the film that deals with the pub crawl was funny enough and maybe they should have concentrated on that . do n't think i 'm being overly critical because i hold these guys to a higher standard ergo the generous four star rating . regardless , if you have n't seen `` shaun '' you probably would appreciate this film more than those of us that have .

> most people consider band on the run as the greatest achievement of paul mccartney 's solo career . with the high quality of songs , it 's tough to argue that point . the title track is a mini masterpiece , going through four different musical passages , sharp lyrics , tight instrumentation and a top-flight vocal performance . `` jet '' is a roaring rocker with a great horn section . `` bluebird '' is a lush , beautiful ballad that mr. mccartney is best known for . `` mrs. vanderbilt '' has a classic , pumping bassline that shows off what an inventive bassist mr. mccartney is . the song has an infectious `` ho , hey , ho '' chorus that pops up later in the album . `` let me roll it '' contains a fiery vocal performance and `` mamunia '' is a pretty mid-tempo song with heavenly harmonies . `` helen wheels '' is ballsy rocker about his car and `` picasso 's last words ( drink to me ) '' is a simple song that could be a pub sing along . `` nineteen hundred & eighty five '' closes out the album and revisits the main musical themes that run throughout the album . critics hailed the album upon its release and it was a strong comeback from the lackluster red rose speedway . the album went to number one and became the first album in history to hit number one on three separate occasions and contained three top ten singles .

> my preference is to buy printer ink before i need it so that when a cartridge goes dry , a replacement is ready . unfortunately i did n't have a replacement on hand recently so had to buy one at office depot for 22 dollars . then so as not to run out again , i bought this two cartridge set from amazon for 27 dollars , a great buy compared to what i paid for one ink cartridge at office depot.occasionally i use generic black ink from databazaar with ( so far ) no ill effects . on text one wo n't notice much of a difference if any compared to ome , and on photos there might be a slight difference in sharpness and contrast . the main difference i 've experienced is that the noncanon ink cartridges have a noticeable shorter life . these cartridges are used in my canon mp 970 printer with excellent results.i 'd certainly buy these inks from amazon again . the price is good and the inks arrived within several days of ordering using amazon prime .

> this detailed account sometimes reads with the inside perspective of a tom clancy thriller . famed watergate reporter bob woodward 's `` fly on the wall '' story relies on detailed accounts from excellent sources who were in the room when key decisions were made . this exposition lives up to his reputation , and even promotes it to another level - if there is one . he takes us inside the white house bunker , camp david and the halls of political power . sometimes you 'll think you 're reading yesterday 's headlines , but the story is more interesting when woodward tells it . his narrative line is strong and you never feel that he is pandering to an action-film audience . this volume 's most important contribution is its colorful portrayal of the key decision makers and its insight into how things really worked in washington at the nation 's most critical moment . we highly recommends this book to anyone yearning for a deeper insight about the world trade center attacks and their continuing aftermath .
= packed with knowledge !

> i read numerous reviews while searching for an affordable replacement router ( my dynex cheapy bit the dust in less than 1.9 years ! ) did not want to spend hours and hours setting up all my computers , so this sounded like the right one . it was well packaged , took it right out of the box reviewed the directions and then began setup , since i deliberately went slow ( so as to only do it once ) it actually took less than 25 minutes to get it up and running , which is something , since my mac typically wo n't play nice with windows and other products running , but it all worked out beautifully , i set it up on the mac and went from there . yep , definitely would buy it again and it really has been living up to the kudos it has received , have run it for several weeks , with no more missed or dropped internet moments . i am a happy camper . : )
= great new router easy setup !
< great router , great price

> i got sucked into this one just like the first of the series . more action , adventure , and twists.it has been decided that all members of the society must have a tracking device installed in case anything happens , so they can be found . tris is a bit suspicious of this ... and for good reason . she wakes in the middle of the night to everybody in her dorm silently getting dressed and walking out the door in perfect unison . she throws on shoes and runs out the door , trying to duplicate the eerie perfection of their simulation-induces unison . the group marches into the abnegation portion of town , dragging people from their homes and slaughtering officials . tris has to stop pretending when eric decides he is going to kill four and pulls a gun to his head . tris and four bolt and the action begins.i would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed divergent . it is a worthy addition to the story .

> after they crafted a masterpiece with terminator 2 ; writer/director james cameron and action superstar arnold schwarzenegger re-teamed for this over the top comic action romp that ranks up there with arnie 's great action flicks . good 'ol ah-nold plays a covert intelligence agent whose secret life as a spy is revealed to his wife of 15 years ( jamie lee curtis who goes from homely house wife to hot damsel in almost a split second ) while he gets mixed up in a terrorist plot to smuggle nuclear weapons . ethnic stereotypes are abound , and the term suspension of disbelief comes into play quite a bit , but one ca n't help but love true lies as a bonafide comic action classic . tom arnold is surprisingly great as arnie 's long time partner , and the film also stars cameron regular bill paxton ( great as a deceitful used car salesman ) , tia carrere , and a young eliza dushku as arnie 's daughter .
= an over the top action classic ; arnie/cameron style
< arnie 's great action romp

> liked the suspense . it was great until the vatos joined the party . plot started to stink then . why the hell would they run out of a safe house across a big lawn when they have a place to make a stand . would n't the police officer know not to give up her gun why was that so easy ? would n't she know not to run and to hold position why would they run and give up the house to run into the unknown . nonsense . i liked the alien and i guess they needed a way to get them in the forest they should have come up with a better way . also , why would half past crazy swim in a pool naked with all these unknown men . underwear i could understand you got an armed criminal running around . dumb and dumber . not in the mood for lost ii .

> the book covers all of the basics of neurolinguistic programming including submodalities , rapport , mission , values , and perceptual positions . in most cases , it is quite light on terminology and instead provides very practical exercises to help the reader to internalize nlp . a reader who carries out all of the exercises in the book will definitely develop a strong internal sense of nlp and the power that it can provide . the reader will not necessarily be able to explain all of the concepts , but ultimately the purpose of any nlp training must be to get it & # 8220 ; in the muscle & # 8221 ; , so for the non-specialist , this is a highly useful book . definitely would recommend it to anyone who needs a minor or major change in his/her life . definitely an appreciating and approving thumbs up for that book .

> i may be biased because i love great cinematography and stories about famous painters but , regardless , this is one beautiful dvd ! it 's a slow story but if you can stay with it , this film offers some of the prettiest images i 've ever seen on film . scene after scene looks like a classic painting come to life . sometimes the cameras stay on subject longer than normal , affording the viewer time to really soak it up.scarlet johannson says very little but is fascinating to watch . for the first-time viewer , there a tension that builds throughout the film leaving wondering what bad thing is about to happen . the story is not an upbeat one , yet not depressing either.this movie inspired me to read the book , and i enjoyed that , too . either version , you ca n't go wrong .

> nell ( angela `` may '' bettis ) and her husband have just moved into the decrepit lusman arms apartment building . nell finds herself surrounded by weird / creepy neighbors and bizarre goings-on . meanwhile , a masked phantom is using various tools to murder tenants one by one . this all leads nell on a deadly search for answers . she discovers a mysterious puzzle to solve in order to reveal the dark secrets of the lusman arms . there is certainly more to the old building than meets the eye ! tobe hooper does a splendid job of creating tension and adding humor . sort of an odd mix of texas chainsaw massacre , phantom of the opera , and the 4th floor . i thoroughly enjoyed toolbox murders and recommend it highly to anyone who likes a bit of mystery w/ their carnage ...

> i would n't think we 'd need an oven thermometer . is n't the oven setting correct ? well , at times it is n't . my wife is an artist and needs an oven to dry certain types of paints . both the timing and the temperature must be correct . so , we bought a countertop oven for the garage and she purchased this inexpensive taylor thermometer to make certain the temperature of the oven corresponded with whatever the controlling gage said . it corresponded rather closely . next we tested our kitchen oven and it was low by about 20 degrees f. many ovens are way off and we can easily make the small adjustment . in any case , our taylor thermometer worked well and provided an inexpensive check.gary peterson
= provided an accurate check .
< worked well and provided an inexpensive oven .

> the book is a guided ( quite guided ) tour of a dozen homes with the items on display called out with the philosophy that the images and curios in one 's home are , or should be , a reflection on the lives of the residents of that home . seems like a sensible idea , and the execution is very good . had figured on just thumbing through , seeing the designs and maybe absorbing something , but i took the time to read the descriptions and explanations . am not willing to completely buy into the notion of home decorating as the `` things that matter '' completely , else what does a knock-off wassily chair imply ?

> this book has about one-fifth the `` story line '' even of book 4 , and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux , greyscale , bad weather and maggoty food . not what one would expect from the author being touted as the `` american tolkein . `` it 's utterly unsatisfying , to the point where i am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.if you feel compelled to read it , just to find out how bad it is for yourself , at least do n't spend any money on it . go get it at the library . you 'll feel slightly less ripped off that way

> this collection has some of the best of mst3k . first off , i already had boggy creek ii on a mst3k tape , but i was more than willing to pay for a dvd version of it . time chasers and merlin 's shop of mystical wonders are perfect . movies so bad they were good.the touch of satan is , in some ways , truly bad , but in the end it has great moments , mostly in the skits . tom 's grandmother alone is worth it . the interview with mike nelson and kevin murphy is a great extra.buy it if you are a fan . buy it if you want to be one .

> this is a nice simple basic case . my husband likes that it does what it is supposed to do ( as far as the case goes ) without a lot of extra bulk or `` frills '' . the qr code for the `` find me '' part is a bit odd . as much as i 'm a geek and love the concept of qr codes they really have not caught on and my husband ( who is self employed ) just sees it as a bother . in reality it is easier for him to send an email from his phone that to instruct someone in how to scan a qr code .

> this has to be one of the greatest books ever written . my daughter read the book and then convinced my wife to read it . my wife bought this one as a gift for me , but it took me months to get to read it because she reread it several times and then my son borrowed it to read and then finally i was able to read it . it is a book that is hard to put down and i will never part with my copy . i recommend this book to everyone i know and have had many people tell me that you can not read this book just once .

> south beach diet protein fit cinnamon raisin cereal bars do have an intense taste of cinnamon raisin bun but it seems mismatched with the dense , chewy texture.i liked the flavor but then noticed a little bit of an artificial , vitamin or soy aftertaste . these are n't bad but they are not something i truly enjoyed eating.each bar is 130 calories with 3 g of fiber and 9 g of protein primarily from soy which is fairly impressive . *** = it 's okay .

> i put this book down several times because it was all about the sex . then , she started talking about the characters . the book was hard to put down toward the end.this is not just a sex book , it is about a man that is `` broken '' . u really start to feel for the characters.yes , she does say a lot about his `` looks '' . i think it is cause she is insecure about herself.this was worth the read .

> the school of rock is about a man named dewey finn who just wo n't `` grow up . '' dewey has been doing odd jobs the last several years , living off his roommate and best friend , all so he can keep playing with his band and eventually get their big break . then , one of the younger members of the band has a mutiny and kicks dewey out . dewey is despondent and after being seriously threatened to be thrown out of his apartment , he takes a job as a substitute music teacher at a high class private school pretending to be his roommate . dewey gets the bright idea of getting the kids to be his new band and the musical hilarity begins.the school of rock is implausible and is predictable ( almost completely ) . however , it 's also highly amusing and entertaining . i am not a huge fan of the rock music that is triumphed in the movie . despite this , i was able to enjoy the movie and it 's soundtrack . jack black is at his finest . also , joan cusack is perfect in her role as the strict principal , rosalie mullins , who longs for a little bit of love and friendship . the kids in the film are a joy to watch and the play off of black 's manic energy with an eager glee that the best of performers would have a difficult time dealing with . the movie does n't have any violence or foul language , though there are a few crude jokes and references to drug use . rock on , man and stick it to the man .

> i am sad that we 're getting to the end of reg wexford . i have been reading this series for many , many years , and i have always loved . it . in this book , reg is newly retired , and he and his unflappable wife dora are dividing their time between their house in kingsmarkham and a converted carriage house in london . reg has been enjoying his retirement , but does find that time sometimes hangs heavy on his hands . when he is asked by a former subordinate who is a dci in london to help with a cold case he jumps at it . four bodies are found in an underground culvert in the yard of an old and infamous house . and three of them had been there for at least 12 years . the fourth body had only been there for about two . it 's difficult for wexford to piece together who the bodies are , why they are there and why has one body only been there for two years . i found that a retired wexford is just as enoyable as a full dci wexford . he 's still as sharp as a tack and he uncannily knows people and what makes them tick . ms. rendell is a master novelist and no one can touch her in plot building ; or in character building either for that matter . i really enjoyed this book and am sad to be coming to the end of wexford 's long and storied career .

> have you ever moved a scale and suddenly it added weight . it is bad enough when you know you ate too much , but when it is the scale 's fault , it gets exasperating . which is why i enjoy this scale.and there are n't any fancy buttons to use to calibrate it either . when you move the scale or change the batteries , simply step on the scale ( ignoring the weight ) , and get off letting the scale set to zero . when you get back on , it is calibrated ! to be certain , just repeat the step more than once . your weight should remain consistent ! it comes with batteries ( four aaa ) , and it also includes a very cute measuring tape ! what a nice surprise.i love the glass , which makes it easy to clean , and the light up numbers are very helpful . they are large enough for me to read without my glasses.why only four stars ? we have multiple family members , and i prefer to have my weight kept private . so having my weight appear every time my husband or daughter uses the scale is a bit disconcerting . i wish i could turn this feature off.i suggest this is best for a single person tracking weight rather than a family because of the tracking feature.i received a complimentary sample to test for me to review . the scale will be used in a local homeless shelter for women .

> i did n't think that she could top mrs thumb but benjamin has outdone herself . i held my breath the whole time i was reading . i felt as if i was on a roller coaster , one minute i loved charles and the next he needed to learn a lot of things . their story is heartbreaking . for a couple that did so many firsts , they really had a rough time . melanie always does a lot of research and really does n't take these stories lightly , so i know she intended only the best carved out for them , trying to stay true to them and go with what she information she had.i ca n't imagine being stalked beyond your worst nightmares , someone wanting to know what you were doing every moment . charles seemed to really be demanding at times and the kidnapping of their eldest is pure heartbreak for any parent . i do n't know many that recover.each time melanie writes i want to know more , so that to me is an excellent writer . a job well done . although we wait awhile for the next book , it is so worth it ! i gobbled every word up , it went way too fast still but that is ok. i want to know more about anne , and maybe charles !

> of all my pencil sharpeners , this bostich pencil sharpener is my current favorite for many reasons:1 ) it sharpens quickly and quietly ( for an electric pencil sharpener ) . the pencils come out extremely sharp , sharper than from any of my other pencil sharpeners.2 ) although the motor does n't stop running when the pencil is sharp , it also does n't continue to eat the pencil.3 ) i do n't have problems with it breaking the pencil lead.4 ) it 's attractive and has good weight , so it does n't slide all over the table when i 'm sharpening.there are only a few minor problems:1 ) it sometimes sharpens the pencil unevenly so that one side of the pencil still has wood and the other is fully exposed . if i put the pencil back in and tilt it a tiny bit , that does take care of the problem.2 ) when i take the shaving tray out , there are some shavings that did n't make it into the tray laying inside the sharpener . it 's a little messy.overall , this would be a good pencil sharpener for someone who needs something quiet , quick and stylish .
= my best pencil sharpener yet .
< a good pencil sharpener

> there is no question that queen has been , and always will be one of the most influential rock bands of all time . even 20 years after the sad death of freddie mercury from aids . the group has still never lost that luster , and that is because great songs still sound and stand the test of time . that is the case with bohemian rhapsody . since it came out over 35 years ago , the song still is just as adventurous and dynamic from the voice freddie showed , and the way that brian may jammed his guitar through the song . it still has never lost its edge , and one of the reasons is that you hear something new , and strong just each and every time you hear it . just the way queen made it years ago . they were ahead of their time , and if you 're new to queen , than you definitely should do the fandago the way they did , and get this song.song : a+

> as a diabetic , i keep a close eye on how i feel , which i can verify with a glucose meter , but being sensitive to our bodies is an important part of taking care of ourselves.jarrow seems to be a good company and i accepted the tablets to consider for a review.the problem is , i 'm not a chemist or biologist , and i ca n't certify anything important about these . i can tell you they smell nice and that they are easy to take . even if my blood sugar were to vary , i would n't be able to certify the cause.i have limited my taking them to once a day ( to see how i adjust ) since i am taking other medication , and they have not produced any problems , digestive or feeling like my blood sugar has gone too low.your experience may vary , but these seem to be doing well with me so far .

> this is an attempt to bring john gray 's ideas from `` men are from mars , women are from venus '' to a teenage crowd . the author does a nice job with his chatty parts , the overall attempt to educate teens about the biological reasons behind the two sexes ' different attitudes and actions ultimately fails because there are too many parts of the book that read like a science text book . most teenagers i know ( i 'm a teacher in a public school ) do n't want to bog themselves down reading scientific reasons about why a member of the opposite sex is cute or acts the way they do , they go by their gut instincts.hypothalmus ? hippocampus ? i do n't think so.maybe college students would like this book , but i doubt today 's young adolescents will be biting .

> i am convinced sleeping bags are like tents . they are never comfortable at what they are rated for . a six man tent is better for four , unless you sleep like sardines . a 30 degree bag is better at 50 , unless you only need to struggle to survive . other than that , this suisse mummy bag is comfortable.i tend to like being extra warm when i sleep , so in 50 degree weather , i doubled up my sleeping bags ( this mummy bag inside another sleeping bag ) , put on a sweatshirt , placed a hand warmer at the foot of the bag , and was quite cozy.there was a velcro tab on the suisse bag that i had to make sure did not scratch my face . that part was ill-conceived . they could have used softer velcro or placed it lower to prevent problems . otherwise , i slept well . at 5'5 '' , the bag fit me with room at my feet to spare . the pull cords around my face and neck provided a comfortable fit to prevent cold air leaking into the bag.at night 's end , i rolled the sleeping bag up but found it was easier to put back in the stuff bag by just stuffing it in . the bag looks like tightly stuffed sausage . it 's a nice , compact size , but i 'm surprised by how heavy it is . the little roll feels very dense . i do n't mind , since i do n't hike with it . i like the space savings in my car . every little bit helps when camping .

> when they decided to remake this series , they did it right . the twelve human colonies have recovered from their war with the cylons , mechanical beings created to make life easier . the cylons have gone off to new pastures and have not been heard from in forty years . the battlestar galactica , the last remaining battlestar from the original war is about to be decommissioned and turned into a museum . it is during the decommissioning ceremonies that the cylons make their return known . they can now look like us and managed to catch the human worlds with their pants down.things get tense as commander adama finds himself the senior officer in the fleet and the secretary of education finds herself accepting the office of the presidency . as the surviving humans band together , styles clash between the two leaders . in the end it is decided to look for the mythical thirteenth colony on earth . this is the hope that will bind the refugees together during the series.i was very impressed . i had caught part of the series on television and decide to give the mini-series a try . the acting , plotting and visuals are all so far above the original it is almost a crime to compare them . but my recommendation is not to buy this because the mini-series is included in the season one collection . there is no reason to buy it separately ( wish i had known that ) . if you like action and drama that is aimed at a thinking adult audience , then this is a show for you .

> leslie is so good . i , like most exercisers , like to go for regular outdoor walks , but when the weather is bad or too hot , then this is the next best thing and i truly believe that you can burn as many calories as outdoor walking if you give this your all.the workout is made up of five walking cycles all of which are around 30 minutes each ( or just a little under ) . the first workout is the easiest ; it 's the basic march , kick , step touch and knee lift routine that you may have come to be familiar with already . the next three , incorporate body toning ( arms , abs and lower body ) which make it a little more challenging and then finally comes the hardest of them which is the speed walking routine and it honestly is intense and more challenging than you 'd think . you can feel the burn in most of the routines , but this is the toughest and you 'll feel it for a day or two later . i certainly sweat up a storm in this last segment.for me , i feel that i work harder doing this dvd workout than when i go walking outdoors on my own because she is using motivating music that has fast beats that keep your feet moving fast . i really love doing this and highly , highly recommend it .

> for each day in 2003 , this book has a paragraph about an event in the history of science and technology and a url containing more information about the event . after that , there is a short description of a topic related to computing technology , a tip of the day with specific information about the topic and a download of the day . most of the referenced downloads are either shareware or freeware , which can easily keep you busy for a long time.the topics are well chosen , as they kept my interest throughout the entire book . in general , several pages are devoted to a theme , for example eight days are used to describe aspects of computer gaming . other themes are an introduction to linux , health , privacy , macintosh , blogging and a guide for buying gifts for geeks . of course , a few pages are not enough to impart extensive information , but that is not the goal . as a primer and a pointer to detailed information , it is an excellent resource.you could easily spend the better part of a year following through with all the information and software pointed to in the book . i have noted many locations so that i will able to return to them when i have the need for more data on that specific topic .

> hank williams / the original singles collection plus ( 3 cd set ) : several different small and large box sets make various claims about what they contain of the hank williams legacy - with various degrees of truthfulness . in short , the hank williams catalog is a total mess . for the fan of his hits , it is more than confusing when trying to find a decent collection.this 3 cd set ( originally from polydor ) with 84 songs , is the one set that gives you all hank 's hits plus a fair representation of his other great songs . the quality of the tracks varies at times according to the quality of the source but the greater part of this box set sounds very very good.as an anthology , this set gets five starsfor those curious for still more , i suggest also getting the hank williams ' `` luke the drifter '' cd , which gives a sampling of hank recording as his ` alter ego'.the rest of us can only wait and hope that bear family records will be allowed to make a hank box series someday .

'' is used at least seven times , indicating lazy writing.there 's also a lot of repeated shots of the same freaky images over and over again to the point of being tiresome ; there is some very annoying use of strobe/flashing lights which gets on my nerves.there you go . use this info to your advantage .

> although disappointed in the demise of sean bean 's character eddard stark , the series still holds a lot of promise because of the rich storytelling , acting , directing , special effects , sets and scenery , and music . the second season is well worth owning if you want to see more of the saga from the first season . if you are new to the series or have n't seen the first season in awhile i suggest you see the first season first . i watched this straight through after year since viewing the first season and found myself wishing i had went back and watched the first season before starting . this is complex story with pieces and moves like a chess game , but of course even the best layed moves can be foiled by outside forces . the addition of magic , undead , and dragons adds to the tapestry it weaves . if you enjoy complex dramas with some medieval fantasy you will probably like it.ca luster

> i bought my casio fs-115ms plus-sr scientific calculator for $ 15 at staples and have been completely satisfied with it . this calculator , in addition to basic calculations , has keys for functions in algebra , geometry , trigonometry , statistics , pre-calculus , etc . it weighs under 4 ounces with battery and cover , and the keys are big and reponsive . most of the basic functions are intuitive , while you 'll need to study the user 's guide for the more advanced functions and modes.specifically i like the following features : - lots of calculator functions as i mentioned earlier.- it has a solar cell and also a button battery , so during the day it uses solar power , while at night it uses battery power . there is no backlighting , though , as this is an inexpensive model . also , replacing the button battery ( lr44 ) requires unscrewing the back off . luckily , the battery should last at least 2-3 years under moderate night-time use.- it has a two-line lcd display . the b & w ; lcd is very sharp and clear . the first line displays the formula you entered , and the second line shows the result.- intuitive interface . the buttons are clearly marked and it does n't take any time to get started on the basic functions . things like square root and logarithm are also easy to figure out . casio calculators have always had consistent user interface over the different models.the one thing i wish were better is the cover , which is the detachable type . it takes a bit of effort to detach it . to casio 's credit , the cover can be attached to both the front ( for protection ) and back ( for storage ) of the calculator.in short , the fs-115ms plus-sr is a terrific scientific calculator for its excellent price . its dual power source ensures usability in most situations.this casio is `` permitted for use on sat and psa/nmsqt .

> `` magic 's price '' is the darkest and most gripping of the last herald-mage trilogy . it is heart-wrenching , and the closing epilogue is at once satisfying and poignant.in the final book , vanyel is older , wiser , and still dealing with his grief from losing tylendel . he has had many lovers , even fathering children with women despite his own attraction to men . tylendel is his lifebonded . mercedes lackey solves the problem of vanyel 's loneliness with stefen , a bard with the power to sing away pain . stefen is young enough to be vanyel 's son , yet he is tylendel reincarnate ( though tylendel was slightly older when they first met ) stefen 's courtship of vanyel is at once romantic and humorous . the rarely humored vanyel finally laughs , finding love in the process.however , tragedy darkens their blissful world . vanyel 's beloved aunt savil is murdered , as are other herald-mages . vanyel is brutally gang-raped . while the villain is vaguely defined ( a common problem in lackey 's writing ) , vanyel gives the final battle his all . in the epilogue , however , lackey shows that death does not have the last word.when mercedes lackey created the character of vanyel , she said she intended for him to be gay , connecting it to him being the last herald-mage . though he has fathered children , he dies without heirs of his own and a family . he finds love with stefen , who mirrors himself at a younger age ; paradoxically , vanyel sees him like his father , and emulates his mother . in some ways , vanyel drowns in his own image like narcissus , yet in the end he is redeemed through his ultimate sacrifice . in the beginning , vanyel was a vain peacock ; in the end , he is the fiery phoenix .

> this tome serves two purposes as a cautionary book for humans in future encounters against the zombie horde and to provide an `` oral history '' of the global war on terrorism in which the insurgent living dead came within a bite or two of winning . the cia offers a slam dunk proof that the zombie revival started in china as a result of the government campaign of `` health and safety '' sweeps . other nations either built great wailing or `` berlin '' walls to hide behind or were overwhelmed . though london was overrun , intrepid queen elizabeth remained in the city as a rallying point insisting to bring it on from inside the safe green zone walls of windsor castle . in north america , the president used the zombie invasion as proof that if you do n't stop them over there , you will have to stop them here ( impeccable logic as where else could you stop them ) . keep in mind they are slow so look into their eyes , but not too close ; for it they can not blink due to desiccated or is that desecrated eyelids , then off with their heads.world war z is irreverent and satirizes the pompous stands of politicians as much as the zombie movie moment . fans of both will enjoy this fun oral history that lampoons anything and everything from `` bird flu '' denial to the bush effect ( formerly known as the pygmalion effect ) in which you make a claim , take action , and when your original assumption proves false insure the only option is to stay the course to prevent zombies from ironically being the last living left standing.harriet klausner

> after my kid left a candle burning in her room on a christmas eve a few years ago , i banished candles from the house . in the past couple of years , i 've gone through a variety of battery operated candles . so far , these are the best.each pillar style candle comes with three aaa batteries already installed . all you need to remove a tab that keeps the batteries from making contact with the connectors.the candles are very realistic looking as they have a wax exterior that is crafted to give the appearance of an already used candle . each candle has a flame which flickers and gives the impression that it is the real deal.the candles i have are ivory in color so they go with every decor and are season proof.in spring and summer , i might ring them with flowers , in the fall i use leaves , and at chistmas holly and evergreen wreathes or boughs set them off.these come with a remote control and a button battery that turns them off and on . if you forget , the very worst thing that might happen is that you 'll have to replace the batteries.from my experience , the batteries work for a long time . the manufacturer claims the batteries will last for 120 hours . given that these are normally never on for more than 3 to 4 hours a night , that is good usage in my book.i consider these more evolved uncandles . they look great , are easy to operate , and safe .

> while ostensibly a story written for teens ( and , perhaps a few advanced pre-teens ) , the story line should ( could ) appeal to almost any age range . the plot line , briefly , deals with a distopian future in which children ( i believe anyone under the age of sixteen may be considered a child ) are compelled to fight to the death , but for what ? the story indicates that it is for a kind of personal glory ( not to mention a lot of money ) , but make clear why anyone would put themselves in such a position . the film setting is beautiful . it reminded me of some of the scenery in the southern appelacian mountain area of the u.s. the opening scene , at the very beginning of the `` contest , '' reminded me of the beginning if the japanese ninja film `` shin no obi . '' in which the young students , who have just been given their swords are told to kill the person standing next to them . as might be imagined , chaos and confusion reign until someone actually follows the directive . the futuristic aspects of the film are well done and , i believe , are intended to show the increasing gap , in this country , between those who have much and those who have little . i believe this movie is worth seeing and i 'm curious about what will be made of the sequel .

> this tape is very funny , a joy to listen to , although if you are n't very familiar with the history of star trek , you will not understand many of the jokes . the premise is that an asteroid is on a collision course with earth and q has the power to prevent it . spock has traveled back in time in an attempt to convince q that humans are worth saving . a challenge is issued and the two engage in a verbal battle of wits , logic , personality and intelligence . riddles are stated , puns and subtle insults are thrown and humanities flaws and successes are cited.spock remains his logical self , although he allows a bit of a sprite to appear in his personality . q is still the trickster , yet he allows some of the respect he has for spock to show through . recorded in front of a live audience , the performances of nimoy and de lancie are excellent . the writing is also superb , many of the jokes and personal barbs are subtle and you must pay close attention or you will miss them . spock wins the debate and q moves the asteroid away from the earth so it will not collide with it for another two decades or so . `` just so that humanity will have something to challenge them in the future .

> denzel washington seems incapable of giving anything short of a great performance . he can be tough , scared , or tender , as the moment requires and this movie requires him to be all three . he plays a man who is devoted to his family and who is frustrated because the reduced hours of his job have caused a family financial crisis . when his son collapses on the baseball field because of a serious heart condition , john q . ( washington ) discovers that his insurance coverage has been reduced and will not cover a required heart transplant . after exhausting all the legal means at his disposal , john q. takes over the hospital at gun-point and demands that his son be given a heart . the script then begins to spiral into melodrama and it becomes somewhat preachy . the message of poor health care for lower-income people may be legitimate , but it is presented in a heavy-handed manner . despite these flaws , there are some tender and some tense moments in the film . watching denzel washington is worth the price of admission .

'' my kids love this book.we have learned a ton from rosalyn schanzer 's work -- `` how we crossed the west ( lewis and clark ) '' and `` gold fever ( california gold rush ) '' and `` john smith escapes again ( pocahontas and more ! ) '' and `` how ben franklin stole the lightning '' have built information into my little learners -- information that we have turned into book reports and field trips and projects.thank you , rosalyn schanzer.ps -- now , could you do it again ? i need a good one on the negro leagues in baseball ( hint hint ) .

> honestly , writing a review for this book is very difficult becuase i do not want to spoil it for anyone . let 's see -- if you are in to fairytale or predictable books , pass it up . if you enjoy great writing that is just the opposite , give this a read . i really did enjoy it ! ! the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because i feel that that there could have been a bit more character building for jacob . i realize that the narrator is the father so it is all through his eyes , but still , it would have been nice to have seen a confrontation or even a discussion with his son about what happened . even if you think your child is innocent , which i would too , i would still have a converstation with him/her about why he/she was being accused.i did n't see the ending coming , which made the book for me : - )
= not a predictable ending ! !
< great book ! !

> i have been reading more and reading more widely since my husband bought this for me for christmas . i now realize i was cutting back on the number and variety of books i read because of logistics . for example , at the end of a busy day , i 'll remember a book someone recommended that sounded interesting , and without getting up from the chair i can download a sample , and if i like it then download and read the whole book . it 's not a good reason , but it seems that the delay of acquiring a physical book was causing me to miss out on reading a lot of them . i also now realize how many times i did n't buy and read a book because our bookshelves are already so full ! the kindle has revitalized my reading life and brought me many many hours of pleasure .

> in writing this book , jane velez michell had a daunting task . writing about a sociopath with zip redeeming qualities who has already been exposed in minute detail seems redundant . despite the fact that i followed this case and thought i knew everything about jodi arias and her overinflated ego , jvm did a fine job of presenting the case against arias in detail and tying it all into her repeated history of narcissism and violence that started early in her life and continues to present day.if a reader has any reservations as to whether arrias has landed in the right place , this book will put their minds to rest.jodi is a sociopath who has gotten her just rewards .

> john ritter is/was always one of my favourite comedic actors . he had such brilliant timing and the perfect face for delivering great lines . in this show , he played a caring father who was strict enough to let the kids know who was boss , but still had fun with his family.i can not wait for this to come out on dvd . it 's so funny and this was probably the best season ever . if you have n't seen this show yet , you must do yourself a favour and get a copy when this is released . it 's fantastic and something i know i 'll enjoy watching many times over .
= absolutely brilliant and funny : - )

> so in the end the question should be `` was it worth it '' . yes is my answer . almost all of the things i wanted to see as a fan happened . this does n't mean that it is predictable . far from it . this one takes a lot of twist and turns.one thing that i really loved was how she gives minor characters the spotlight to give them a curtain call . my favorite being neville longbottom . it makes the whole story seem more satisfying.bottom line this is a great book in a franchise you owe it to yourself to read this series .

> andrew klavan has crafted a finely honed thriller , one that if alfred hitchcock were alive to read , would surely be optioned by the master to convert to film . in many ways , this book reminded me of the man who knew too much , or north by northwest . all of them have the common element of a person thrust into the center of a situation where other players know what is going on , but the protagonist , and ourselves , are left to wonder about the actions that are taking place.a quick read , and well-written .

> although not very true to life , this is a very entertaining series about a us marshal . we follow his exploits from his original assignment in miami to a reassignment in kentucky , near where he grew up . our hero tends to run into trouble and adventure at every turn , but it is the dry sense of humor that prevails throughout every episode that really distinguishes the series . this is a decidedly different and superior cop show . highly recommended .

> this book tells how to apply for medicare , how to claim the benefits , what to do in many situations and when to do it.i did n't appreciate how complicated medicare was and now see that one needs a bit of an education on the subject . parts a & b - not simple . the book even outlines choices one might make to ensure more adequate coverage in addition to medicare , if one can afford it .

> a lot to like about the quality of this sitcom , but something lacking in terms of dimension . there are some funny lines , particularly in earlier episodes , but does seem like more of a comic strip . some of the characters become a bit stale once the initial joke of their character is understood . wonderful cast members , like amy sedaris , could deliver more if the material allowed it .

> & # 8220 ; grand piano & # 8221 ; is a spanish/us thriller about tom selznick ( elijah wood ) , a concert pianist with stage fright . after a five-year hiatus he comes back to the stage , but during his performances in a chicago concert hall , someone threatens him to play an & # 8220 ; unplayable & # 8221 ; piece composed by the pianist & # 8217 ; s recently deceased mentor . tom failed it five years ago , and if he fails again or refuses to play now , his movie star wife emma ( kerry bish & eacute ; ) will be dead.i said it & # 8217 ; s a thriller , but perhaps you should not take it too seriously . if you think & # 8220 ; phone booth & # 8221 ; has an incredible premise , & # 8220 ; grand piano & # 8221 ; stretches the film 's credibility to the breaking point and well beyond . the film would be thrilling and entertaining if you can get past how absurd the whole situation really is . after all , why the criminal needs such an elaborate plan ? spanish-born director eugenio mira seems aware of that . some may say it & # 8217 ; s all about macguffin , a plot device to further the story . some part of the film is self-referential , to be sure , anticipating our reaction to the criminal & # 8217 ; s motives for choosing this particular method . to his credit , the film keeps tension pretty high in the earlier part . he also manages to re-create the feel of classic films , with nice camerawork.even so , it is very hard for me to swallow the preposterous story , especially when it ends rather weakly . and please someone give john cusack a role that he really deserves .

> the stand alone thrillers of rosenfelt are all good four star thriller reads . they are well plotted , move right along and if you are looking for some quick entertainment , they will do the job . but they will not knock you out so you are exclaiming days afterwards , & # 34 ; wow , that was terrific. & # 34 ; this is because it is mainly just the clever plot keeping the whole book afloat and once you put it down , you will quickly forget about it . but that 's fine . i do n't expect every book i read to be a five star read.in this novel , there is the murder of a judge . judges can make a lot of people angry just by the nature of their jobs . so the police have to discover which people he rules against to see if they stack up as possible murderers . before they are far along at all , a druggie who is about to start a major prison term handed out by the judge is discovered with major evidence on him linking him to the judge 's murder . but he raises his gun and the detective , luke somers , shoots him dead . case closed ? no . now the case truly opens . because that slain drug dealer has a brother who wants justice plus there are a lot more sinister people with a lot more on the line who had good reason to kill the judge . with that premise , luke , is put in the center of solving the case anew.i figured out who did it fairly early on . it was n't that hard . if this is a big part of these books for you , you might consider this a negative point .

= a well-constructed and fascinating mystery
< interesting and fascinating mystery

> first off please do n't try to compare this to other murder mysteries . it is n't any of them and vice versa . you might as well compare it to `` fade to black '' , which by the way has nothing in common . imagine yourself one of the top profilers working for the police department or the fbi . now you have a string of murders but the modus of operation ( mo ) by the perpetrator ( perp ) changes with each murder . some brilliant acting by sigourney weaver , holly hunter , and the underrated harry connick jr. make this movie one of the best thrillers around . it turns out that not only is the mo different , but the murderer is imitating others.others in the sense of jeffrey dahlmer , david berkewitz , ted bundy , and other serial killers . it is bad enough to have someone on the loose like that , but when they follow your interest in them and take an interest in you , it is best not to be in any dark rooms . weaver is a psychological doctor aiding the detective played by hunter . connick jr. is great as a psychotic killer in prison that appears to be assisting a murderer on the streets . the creepy factor is high along with the good scares here and there . i highly recommend purchasing this dvd if you enjoy lesser known thrillers like `` deceived '' , `` black widow '' , and `` vanished '' . i ordered this dvd because it is very good and it has excellent replayability .

> i purchased the kindle device for my daughter and i , as we are both avid readers . we had the kindle up and running within several minutes . my daughter loves the device and actually helped rate this item with five stars . we have not experienced any software or downloading glitches . downloading material from the kindle store is seamless and most books have downloaded in just a matter of a few seconds using the wireless interface.one thing that my old eyes can appreciate is the fact that font sizes can be changed in order to accommodate easier reading with a little less effort . it would be great to have some sort of back-lighting , but this might compromise the appearance of the print itself . when i first began shopping for a reading device , i examined several models and i first considered a touch-screen model , which would allow easier page turning . i am satisfied with the toggle and single buttons that allows this function on the kindle . it would seem that there would be a little wear and tear on the screen surface or protector after having to flip through hundreds of pages over the course of one 's reading experience.we have spent countless dollars on paperbacks and hard-cover books . eventually , like videotapes and cd 's , you begin to run out of space to store these possessions . it is great to have a device that stores these books and i must mention that these books can be purchased at a significantly reduced cost . overall , we are very happy with this purchase .

> viewers who enjoy traditional black and white joel mccrea type westerns with no psychological , sociological , or historical analyses and no clever dialogue will like this 1957 movie where mccrae rides into town disguised as a drifter while , in truth , he is employed by the western union and sent to this town to stop a recent surge of stage coach robberies . there is the usual daughter of a prominent man , in this case the sheriff , who thinks mccrae is a bad man , who tries to persuade her father not to hire him as a deputy , and as usual , she protests too much , and it is clear that she is , even if she does n't know it yet , very much attracted to him and he to her.the villain in this film is vicious ; he kills many unarmed people ; yet there is an aura of niceness to him . he steals because he grew up wanting to play the piano , learnt to play quite well , but could n't take more lessons to become the best he could be because he could n't afford the cost . now , he is drawn to pianos and starts to play , but stops when someone hears his music and he becomes angry . this situation begs for psychological analysis but this was not the style of such films in 1957 .

> there are some questions the all of the great minds in the past centuries have asked themselves , perhaps they answered them , perhaps they did n't but it does n't matter because all of us continue to ask ourselves the same questions . you know the kind of questions i am talking about , those that involve life , death , why.the questions may have answers to some of us . some will answer from a religious viewpoint with the absolute certainty of faith . many of these will answer with absolute certainty but have different answers based on their own particular religion.this book , a novel in official form , is about a person finding the questions and seeking answers . the book is by a motivational speaker who has narrowed these questions down to three . in the book , the characters work through answering the questions and in a charming why that makes for delightful reading.i do n't know why , but i find that i was continuously thinking of the famous poem called desiderata which says in part : 'you are a child of the universe , no less than the trees and the stars ; you have a right to be here.and whether or not it is clear to you , no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should .

> previous reviewers have criticised this album simply because deana only had two albums released on capitol and that the same people are going to buy this.first thing - i have n't bought this because i have all the tracks already , but i assume that this album is aimed at those who did n't buy any of the earlier albums . what they will find are 12 of deana 's finest songs from the first phase of her career.second thing - there were actually three albums released by deana carter on capitol . the first one , also titled did i shave my legs for this ? was released in the uk ( with completely different artwork ) about 18 months before the american did i shave ? album . only three tracks are common to both , including ( of course ) the title track . three of the nine uk-only tracks are to be found on this compilation . americans and canadians can be forgiven for not realising that these tracks were available some years ago in the uk - but that album is now sadly out of print.on the assumption that anybody who already has most of deana 's earlier music wo n't buy this , i give it the maximum rating it deserves for the quality of the music .

> i thought i knew jim rogers from previous books and lots of short interviews . this time he 's far more philosophical and expansive . his opinions and viewpoints are deeper than i imagined . he 's super patriotic , which is why he 's so agitated given some of the current macro problems.i loved roger 's suggestions for government . there 's no chance they 'll be adopted but logically he seems spot on.some of this book is a bit haunting . for example , he discusses how he does n't much get the feeling anymore when in new york that it 's the most happening place . he gets that feeling in a lot of asian cities . i keep thinking about this , that if he 's correct we are in some kind of decline.this is the type of book i can not put down , even if i 've read it a couple times already . i wish i could be like this guy , traveling all over the world and thinking about where civilization will go in the next hundred years .

> my kids and i giggled our way throughduck and goose , tad hills ' first book starring these two lovable characters . with duck , duck , goose , our favorite quacker and honker are back -- but this time there 's another character thrown into the mix , and three is most definitely a crowd.duck is very excited to introduce thistle , the new duck who just moved into the area , to his best friend goose . and , at first , goose is just as happy to meet this new duck.that is , until goose soon learns that thistle is the best at everything , and i mean everything ! she 's the fastest , she 's the best at math , she 's had three butterflies land on her bill at the same time ( compared to goose 's one ) , she can hold her breath the longest , run up the hill the fastest , and ... well , the list goes on and on.goose learns very quickly that thistle is the best , and that no one else can ever hope to measure up . and yet he 's tired of everything always being turned into a contest . so he has no choice but to leave duck and thistle to their own devices and rest , by himself , behind his and duck 's favorite bush.duck , duck , goose is a wonderful book , about meeting new people , the spirit of competition , and the true meaning of friendship . both toddlers and older readers will be enchanted , once again , by tad hills ' brilliant illustrations , and the story will have them alternately laughing-out-loud and commiserating with how left out and lonely goose feels.this one is another winner , and definitely deserves a place on your keeper shelf ! reviewed by : jennifer wardrip , aka `` the genius ''

> william shatner is an ex-military man who is truly good . in the area there are women who work for satan , referred to as the god of darkness . they tempt wicked men and deliver their souls to hell . but one feels it would be far better to tempt those that are not already wicked . she sets her sights on shatner despite the protests of her peers.but the warnings are true . associating with the truly good man has corrupted the demoness . to save her , her peers raise incubus to destroy the man 's sister and drive him to murderous violence . but will it be enough to curse him ? will the demoness return to full evil or will the taint of good remain ? what happens when the god of darkness gets involved ? you will have to watch to see how it gets resolved.this is an italian film and the dialogue is in italian with english subtitles . if bergman had decided to do a film about good versus evil , it might have looked something like this ( although i think bergman would have had a budget for a larger cast and more sets ) . the action takes place in the country where we see the great outdoors , shatner 's house , a church , and an abandoned property . considering that out demoness sends three souls to hell before lunch one has to wonder where the people are and where they live . but that issue is minor as the story drags you in and you stop noticing the lack as they are not necessary to the story . if you like your films full of atmosphere , brooding and moral dilemmas then you might want to check out this oft-overlooked film . check it out .

> a night like this by julia quinn*arc supplied by publisher*anne is a governess and daniel is a recently returned from exile , earl . when they meet at a smythe-smith musicale , some small sparks start flying . we know as well as they that nothing can be done about these sparks ; after all think of the class system in england - an earl and a governess ? well stranger things have happened and so the story begins ! we learn a lot about daniels ' exile and return very early in this book , but we do n't learn anything about anne until later and i love how that seems to make the story much more interesting . when evil things start happening , it is assumed that daniels ` enemy ' is behind it , but can he really be sure . after all he does n't know that there is someone out there that may like to see anne dead too . `` a night like this '' is told with ms quinn usual style ; combining romance with humor and wit , a lot of mystery and excitement and a sensuality that can make you shiver . perfectly fleshed characters allow you to visualize them with no trouble , although this book does n't have ms quinns usual brisk pacing and some parts of it sort of lag , things do pick upon to an almost fever pitch in the second half of the book.a wonderful and worthy read for anyone who has loved ms quinn 's earlier works . in addition , this may be read as a standalone book , since nothing that may refer to earlier works will muddy the reading of this one .

> at the beginning of his presidency , john f. kennedy was determined to put the berlin issue on the back burner , and focus on issues that were nearer to his heart . unfortunately for him , and the world , soviet premier nikita khrushchev was determined to move the berlin issue to the forefront . surprised at president kennedy 's mishandling of the bay of pigs invasion , khrushchev decided that the american president was both indecisive and lacking in courage , and set out to push him for all that he could get . this is the story of what happened in those days in berlin , and in moscow and in washington d.c.overall , i found this to be a very impressive book . the author did a great job of presenting the unfolding of events in the context of what the major players wanted and what they figured they could and could not do . it really does give a good insight into the inner workings of the decision making processes in both the east and the west.i was surprised at how clear this book exposes communism to have been less a socio-economic system than it was a power system , with the strongman/leaders gaming for increased power and prestige . their cavalier attitudes toward the poor and downtrodden of their nations were truly breathtaking to see.like i said , if you really want to understand what happened in this very important year in the cold war , then you really must read this book . i think that its insights are worth the purchase price and more !

> jesse sapirstein is a genius . it 's as simple as that.in reading this masterpiece of an autobiography , i felt that i `` got '' jesse . diagnosed with asperger 's , he appears to fit the classic profile of a high functioning `` aspie . '' i loved his honesty and found it delightful and refreshing.i had to laugh in recognition at how he bluntly told some prosletyzer that he would no doubt throw away the pamphlet he had been handed . i smiled in recognition because that is exactly the kind of response i would have made . in fact , on a personal note , i did tell a pair of prosletyzers who were knocking on peoples ' doors in my building point blank that i was not interested and to go away ; they were wasting their time ; any materials they left would end up in the recycle bin and that i was not going to convert from catholicism . in most cases , i would just lay low and ignore the knocking , but in this case they heard the television on from the hallway and figured they 'd try their luck.in reading jesse sapirstein 's masterpiece , i cheered his natural expression and feel he is an ambassador of goodwill on behalf of all who are on the spectrum . his book will bring smiles and laughter and cheers to many !

> let 's play guess the author.here 's the plot.indiana jones type professor . instead of being an archaeologist this professor is an world renown professor of art , with a little architecture thrown in for good luck.we 're introduced to a woman who is a professional , but probably in another field . she becomes the professor 's sidekick for the rest of the story.they then start getting chased by some mysterious group . the group seems intent on killing our pair.somewhere between the beginning and this point , we get introduced to parts of this other group.our stars now know that they need to save the world from obliteration while still eluding their pursuers . they run from one clue that gives them information that takes them to the next clue.the book ends . sometimes they stop the plot , sometimes they don't.given the above , have i missed the story line of one dan brown book with robert langdon in it ? yes , the book is a good read . this will probably be my last dan brown book unless he comes up with a new format and some new ideas.the question is how long he can continue this and still sell books.if i knew the above , i probably would not have purchased the book unless it was under $ 5.00 .

> the dashwood sisters ( emma thompson , kate winslett , emilie francois ) and their mother ( gemma jones ) are left in a precarious position when mr. dashwood ( tom wilkinson ) dies and the bulk of his estate goes to his son from a previous marriage ( james fleet ) , who allows them a very small stipend on which to live . in a society where women are denied autonomy , they must rely on the kindness of in-laws and pray for advantageous marriages . nevertheless , elinor and marianne hold on to the hope that they will marry for love and not merely economic gain.this engaging and moving film , brilliantly acted , functions for much of its length as a scathing indictment of a time when the circumstances of talented and intelligent women were almost entirely dependent on the men in their lives . however , it becomes complicit in this unfortunate social institution ( spoiler ahead ) with its ending , in which the sisters achieve happiness by marrying the right men . nevertheless , i had become so invested in the characters that i wanted them to have their happy ending and did n't much mind that the form it took actually undercut a major theme of the film .

> while this book does contain a few sensible tips for solving problems using duct tape , most of the content consists of dumb guy jokes . as an occasional handyman , i appreciate the value of duct tape , having found many uses for it , from cleaning spark plugs to fixing the brake light switch on my car . however , the humor in this book is much too crude for my tastes , some of the `` uses '' of duct tape border on the cruel and sadistic . the authors are well aware of this and some of the `` suggestions '' contain a footnote that is a disclaimer . for example , on page 69 there is the sentence , `` or , tape birds and squirrels to trees for dogs and cats . '' this is of course not funny.therefore , if you are a fan of the `` dumb guy '' genre of humor , then you will find this book amusing . however , if that is not to your taste , then you will the bulk of the book boring .

> being a fan of ambient and electronica for some time , i decided to give this a try . i can understand how some may simply hear this as a cheesy reworking of the classics , just a man and his keyboard , but it 's really much deeper than that if you just sit and listen . i suggest not comparing to the originals as much as enjoying what these pieces are themselves . a few tracks do lag , and there are quiet spots , but as a whole i find `` pieces in a modern style '' to be almost hypnotic , and as i said in my review title , rather peaceful . the tracks i prefer the most are `` adiago for strings '' , `` cavalleria rusticana : intermezzo '' , `` l'inverno '' , and the music-box sounding `` triple concerto '' . however the others are fine as well . i say , if you think you might like this , you probably will . it 's well worth the used price if nothing else .

> this is a high quality iron . i highly recommend it . it glides over fabrics better than others and has just the right heft in my estimation.the auto shutoff feature is three-way , something i never had before . i 've always been a little nervous about the safety of irons . it 's very reassuring to me that 30 seconds of inactivity when on the soleplate ( the underside of the iron ) will cause shutoff . it shuts off eight minutes after sitting on its heel . it shuts off if tipped over on its side.the steam burst feature helps for tough wrinkles and also to clean the steam vents . and the ability to vary the amount of steam is essential for ironing different fabrics . over time i expect to appreciate the anti-calcium valve . this feature reduces deposits in the chamber so that the steam vents do n't get clogged over time .

> excellent show with biting satire . and how can you beat the cast ? i just have two problems with it and one may be just life as it is today . number 1 : stereotyping women . come on , is it too much to ask for one strong character who is n't a sex toy or a nag ? number 2 : good god people do your research and get down here to the south and learn a decent accent . john goodman 's wife sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard . we do wear shoes down here and someone in her position would not talk like her . she , i assure you , would have at least one chanel outfit to go with her kelly bag and italian shoes . she would not speak like the woman coming out of that phone -- so off putting .

> good , solid storytelling . ms. rowling 's third installment in the harry potter series continues to add interesting characters and create an even more appealing magical world for the reader to escape into . each book has shown the gradual evolution of harry from a neglected , abused child and mentored into a honorable young man . but the character-building journey is certainly a bumpy ride for young potter . moral messages and the complexities of the human condition abound as each new story has been introduced to the public . one of the underlying messages of the book is that most problems in life are not simply black and white , but more complicated . to convey this point in a fun , exciting manner is the sign of great writing . there 's real heart to this series and deserves a wide readership .

> i re-read this book after finally getting around to reading the last book in the trilogy . i loved it the first time round but it is n't a book that gets better the second time . now i noticed the irritating things like the way the author was repetitive using the 'little falcon ' endearment way too many times . the 'glendruid ' adjective for everything was over the top . the basic story though was still good i think , which was the development of a deep relationship between two people in an arranged marriage . i 'm a great lover of 'arranged marriages turning to love ' books . i like the little bit of paranormal and i think the author set up her trilogy quite nicely . sadly the next 2 books are nowhere near as good as this one .

> this is an awesome series of novels . i was hooked by the first one ( which i had gotten as a standalone novel ) and went on to buy this . i was not disappointed . having all the books in one makes for a rather enjoyable read , since you know that when one book is over , you have the next one right there to read . the stories are zany , the ideas far-flung , and the answer to life completely not what you expect - even though that answer has been parodied several times in popular culture .

> the film at times , satirizes the fairy tale . julia roberts as the wicked queen step-mom narrates in the beginning . lilly collins as snow white was made to look like jennifer connolly in `` labyrinth . '' the humor is simple and basic enough for everyone to enjoy . there are some minor hidden political commentary for us adults . such as when julia instructs brighton ( nathan lane ) to use his imagination and tell the people `` bread is meat '' ( ketchup is a vegetable ) . but the film does n't get bogged down trying to be political , it is just a fun film about aging women desperately attempting to hold on to their youth while competing with their daughter for suitors . ( i did n't mention kardashian . ) the background is cg which gives the film a fairy tale look . the dwarfs are quirky and more akin to the ones we knew in `` time bandits '' than the bumbling group disney gave us . they made good use of the sound track , one that could have been used in any film from 1935 to 1970 ... until the end when they did some ridiculous lip-sync song , directed at the young princesses in the audience . you could tell julia roberts had fun making this production.the film is basically kid safe , some violence and `` horror '' . enjoyable for an adult . this is the film you volunteer to take the kids to go see .

> anax wants to become a member of the academy . in order to be admitted , she must endure a four-hour interview in front of a three member panel . anax has been working with a tutor in order to prepare herself.it is through this interview that the reader learns the history of the world after a devastating plague killed most of the people on the planet . safe behind the great sea fence , her people keep their island safe by shooting any plane or boat that comes within sight.the society is based on rigid rules : men and women living separately , parentage being kept from children , and at one year of age children are tested to determine what class they will be placed in based on their genomic reading ( laborers , soldiers , technicians , or philosophers ) .history is not what it seems.anax learns more about her world during the interview than she did during all her days of preparation . she realizes the academy is n't what it appears to be , but is it too late to change her current path ? genesis is a fast-paced story . it is interesting to read about the post-apocalyptic world anax lives in . bernard beckett does a great job of building the story without revealing too much too soon . the ending will leave you stunned.reviewed by : karin librarian

> as a grad student , i am always looking for ways to organize and file my notes , and these post-it filing tabs are the most durable filing tabs i 've ever used ( and believe me , i 've tried out a lot of different types ) . the feature i like most is the extra thickness which makes these filing tabs more durable and they can hold up to frequent handling , unlike the thinner tabs that either come off or get ripped . the only thing i would note as a drawback is that if these tabs are placed on glossy paper for a long period of time , they do not come off as easily and you have to use caution in peeling them off . i accidentally ripped one off my textbook the other day and part of the textbook page came off with it ! so , just take note of this , especially if you are a student who intends to resell your textbook.these tabs can also be used for folders , project binders , catalogs , files , etc . they are more expensive when purchased at retail stores , and i usually shop around for the best price and stock up . i did receive these particular tabs as part of the vine program but i 'm always in need of more : )

> `` the last prejudice '' tells about the lives of three women - noreen , dahlia and kat . each woman wants the love of a good man . the common denominator of their weight is what binds them . author david rivera jr. , though his characters , deals with the struggles that plus-sized women may face . and not only plus-sized women , but the ups and downs women face with hidden insecurities and the rocky road of love . he did a wonderful job . i really enjoyed `` the last prejudice '' and hope that another book follows with a continuation of these characters.4.5 stars

> my husband is so totally computer illiterate . sure he can get to his email , go on social networks sites , but that 's it . i wanted to get him a tablet that was very `` user friendly '' because truth is , he does n't really need apps . kindle saves the day ! within a couple of days he got into all his social networks , email , surfed videos and used the browser.kindle fire is very user friendly and perfect for someone who just wants to do the basic everyday stuff we all do on the web .

> if you have a cat who fetches paper wads or other items , you might try this toy , too . our siamese likes to play fetch with it . she 's not as consistent as she was with the paper balls , but still it 's not quite as alarming to step on at 4:00 am.the best thing about the pet stages toys for cats is that i have never had a cat who could get them open . their tough exterior guarantees long play life and hopefully no belly-full of filler which could cause serious injuries.rebecca kyle , september 2009

> this was a great match for the 32 & # 34 ; bedroom tv and i 'm sure it will do the job adequately without risk of falling . it 's nicely made , no sharp edges . all hardware was obvious and easy to assemble . instructions are adequate , not frilly . i 'm good with that.it 's a good value for a small weight tv . not really any pan to speak of and limited to about 15 degrees of downtilt.i 'd buy this brand again if i needed one .

> having been at these gigs it was a fore gone conclusion that i 'd buy this cd , but ` live in hyde park ' has so much more to offer than a mere souvenir album for concert going fans . this shows rhcp at the height of their game , playing with verve and skill and showing just why they were the hottest ticket around in 2004 ( and more than likely still today if they were performing ) . this double album gives us many tracks from ` californication ' onwards , as well as a couple from 'blood , sugar , sex , magic ' and from the opener ` ca n't stop ' you know you are in for a real treat . it is difficult to pinpoint particular exceptional tracks as they are all pretty great , ` fortune faded ' is awesome and ` under the bridge ' got a huge crowd response . you also get flea playing trumpet and a brief cover of ` i feel love ' . the amazon review says that the support bands were jeered off the stage . well james brown was n't jeered as everyone seemed pretty over-awed to see a master perform , ` chicks on speed ' were jeered and booed but then they were so bad it can hardly be expressed , but more importantly the crowd were at fever pitch to see this band perform and from hearing this cd you can tell why . when you have rhcp about to perform their greatest hits to a massive crowd , who would honestly want anything else ? for the only live album of this band this ca n't be beaten and for top rock music with a great audience vibe this is unsurpassed . highly recommended indeed.feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .

> i love gadgets , but i guess i was attracted to the 11-function tool as much by the low cost as by its functionality . shipped direct from china , the tool arrived 24 days after i ordered it . the packaging was not as pictured in the description - it was in a little vinyl carrying case , and that was it . ( that 's not a complaint - it saved the trouble of trying to open one of those blister packs . ) luckily the product description includes the different functions , since the instruction card that came with the tool is in chinese only . the tool is made from stainless steel and is about 2 mm thick , weighing about one ounce . how useful is it ? not very . i could n't even get the bottle opener to work . the saw might work in a pinch , but it 's not long enough ( 1.4 '' ) to really be useful . the etched scale ( 4 cm ) is accurate and could be used for metric measurements , but it 's not long enough to be very practical.overall , the tool is worth more as a novelty conversation piece than a worthwhile survival tool . you 'd be better off spending a little more and getting a real multi-use tool for your survival kit .

> this album is one of the worst king crimson pieces as far as conception , but also has some of their best music.what a quandry : `` great deceiver , '' `` lament '' and `` nightwatch '' are three of crimso 's best tracks . that art funk they started to establish was truely edgey -- edgey as the most underground prog , such as henry cow and about thrity vertigo bands i could list . `` fracture '' and the title track are even more exciting . they feature some of fripp 's best work as a composer and improviser , and wetton 's bass playing is increadibly athletic and adventurous -- from the sound of his hands around that fender persicion thick neck , remind me never to pi-s john wetton off.even the mincer and we 'll let you know are nice snippets of what this and could do live , and make no mistake , this was a killer live bandthe problem is , none of this really cohears . crimson should have probably done what pink floyd did with ummagumma-one great studio album and one great live one , realeased as a classic double set . this would have worked much better than the patchwork that keeps this album from being top flight .

> we have loved the boston jacky stories . they have been fun romps with a likable character that occasionally bump into actual history . bloody jack has been a fun character . she is a pirate and a ne'er do well who manages to accomplish some good things here and there . think of the series as a long party at pippi longstockings house.and this is the hangover the next morning.jacky has always been mercenary . she is a pirate . it 's what she does . but in this book she comes across more bratty and mean that self interested . she wanders from one interested to the next like a spoiled toddler . she seems depressed . this really sucks a lot of fun out of the story . it also keeps some of the historical references fro being as interesting as they could since she does n't fully engage.this book also ruined jaimy for me . we have put up with their back and forth silliness for a lot of books for him to turn out to be just mean and low . i was really disappointed in him and their story line.hopefully jacky will be back , fully herself in the next novel . but i could be done with jaimy .

> in the iconic entertainment career of prince , this album produced a first for him ; never before had a release debuted at # 1 , which is where this march 2006 quickly found itself on the billboard 200 chart.distributed through universal records , the 12 tracks clock in at 53:42 , but there was drama surrounding the album ; the title may be referring to a dispute between prince and the landlord of his rented mansion in los angeles , nba player carlos boozer , as the tenant would incorrectly identify the location by that `` address . `` two singles were released before the album - te amo corazon , december , 13 , 2005 ; black sweat , february 2 - but the standout cut is fury , a jimi hendrix-inspired throwback to the psychedelic rock scene of the 1960s , which was released as a single in the uk.the sound leans heavily into the style of r & b ; /funk/rock that prince revolutionized some 20 years back , but the material is fresh and dynamic . the artist is letting the music do all the talking .

> somehow , despite the depth that is brought out in the 2 main characters , katherine/kitty and laney there is a disconnect with them . they were best friends , laney stays in their town , katherine moves to new york city to become the high powered executive and the friendship ends.their neighbor luella leaves her valuable house and belongings to them , but only if they personally divide it up.we see through flashbacks and recollections , their former lives and what they have become . their meeting is acrimonious and bitter . the story moves from past to present , back and forth as we wait for the mystery to be revealed to us of why their friendship ended . in some way , once the reason is revealed it seems trivial and spiteful of them to lose a precious relationship . we are able to see what they have lost and experience understanding.in many ways the story is predictable , but still can be an thought-provoking story to read .

> i have n't seen `` the fantastic mr. fox '' but to my mind wes anderson has n't missed a beat yet . as a whole anderson 's collective works meld into an interesting observation on the quirks of men . marketed as a comedy , `` the darjeeling limited '' tackles heavy themes though anderson 's askewed humor is also present . topics like life , death , and the fragility of family bonds are present here . there 's a certain poignancy on display here . this is a demanding film that i think would reward the most ambitious viewers .

> this is the sad story of a troubled teenager who heads off to the big city to find fame and fortune as an actress . unfortunately , she lacks acting talent or experience and quickly turns to drugs , stripping and hooking . she then `` auditions '' to be an international party girl and eventually winds up in an arab prince 's harem.despite extravagant shopping spress , opulent surroundings and wild parties , life in the harem is a lot like high school , petty , competitive and at times painfully monotonous . women are neither valued nor cherished . there is plenty of sex but no love . there are massive amounts of money but no security . there is outer beauty but just ugliness inside . eventually the author extricates herself from the situation and returns to the states where she is an ostensibly happily married mother . one day she is watching tv and sees the prince and wonders whether he remembers her . ( i 'd guess not . ) hence , this book.i did not particuarly care for this book . it is rather flatly written and she gives short shrift to her removal and return to this country and a normal life . she has no insight into her sexual promiscuity , drug addiction and abuse , lying and materialistic motivations . one wonders whether when the going again gets rough , whether she will again opt for the easy and selfish way out . i ca n't say that this serves as a cautionary tale . she went in knowing what she was doing . it was n't white slavery , it was voluntary servitude . i just hope that her kids will learn to value freedom and have sufficient self respect to avoid the foibles of their mother .

> more and more bands are finally deciding to release albums in the so-called dead months . the strokes did it last year in early january and this year the shins are doing it . after a long break from 2003 's `` chutes too narrow '' , the shins bring us one of the most-anticipated albums for 2007 . `` wincing the night away '' ( 11 tracks , 42 min . ) starts of with `` sleeping lessons '' in a dream-like atmosphere only to then midway through crash into the full band . `` australia '' keeps reminding me of the sound of the smiths . `` pam berry '' finds the band stretching out their musical landscape , with some reggae/surfer sound undertones even . `` phantom limb '' ( first single ) is the traditional shins . then follow the 2 best songs on here : `` sea legs '' finds the band at its most experimental , and i absolutely love it . `` red rabbits '' is equally adventurous . many shin fans do not like these 2 songs , but they are my favorite tracks on the album , and proof that sings-songwrite james mercer will continue to grow . the latter part of the album is more 'traditional ' . the timid yet beautiful `` a comet appears '' is a very appropriate closer.whether this album will bring long-term mainstream success to the shins remains to be seen ( although the album debuted at no.2 on the billboard 200 this week ) . that aside , i absolultey love this album from start to finish , and have n't stopped playing it since i got it a good week ago . highly recommended !

> hunter 's moon by don hoesel is the powerful sophomore novel by the writer of elisha 's bones . cj baxter , a famed novelist , is summoned home to adelia , ny after being gone for over seventeen years by the death of his grandfather . the baxters have long hoped to build a political dynasty like the kennedy 's and those hopes are finally coming to fruition with cj 's brother graham . but not is all it appears between the brothers . one holds a secret about the other that has shaped the entire family 's life and could destroy their future . cj is a likable character , new in his christianity , who just keeps seem to let his temper get the best of him ; he 's on the brink of divorce , facing charges for assaulting a critic , and running from a bench warrant for breaking into his house to steal back his dog . hoesel carefully builds the drama slowly , ratcheting up the tension so carefully as to be almost imperceptible except for the building tightness in the reader 's chest . the dialogue rings incredibly true . a character returning home to face a family crisis and drama is an often used device , but hoesel avoids the cliches that come with it , making the story brilliantly fresh . the scene of teenaged graham 's threat toward ten-year-old cj is haunting and cj 's gut-wrenching fear is palpable . this is a story that will stick with the reader long after the final page .

> it is interesting that the producers of these movies never learn or ask about the annoying back ground noise . this is not music or mood it is just noise . now all they have to do to complete a junk presentation is to add unnecessary flashbacks to replace back story , and a sound bite presentation to mask continuity ; oh no they just did.you can try fast forward and mute which will fix most things but you run the risk that there may be something substantial . however i doubt it.if you can over look the production problems then we come to the actual story . we already know the story so the real reason is to see how it is executed . maybe the rest of the story and incidences have appeal to some people and i am not one to judge . so ignore the bad background noise by junkie xl ( tom holkenborg , ) and focus on the game.interesting enough there are some big name actors in this one.adam cassidy ( liam hemsworth ) aspiring techie is recruited by his company to spy on a rival . of course all is not as it seams and he may just get his come-up-ins . lets watch and see . there may be a love interest but i doubt it .

> i worry that even the & # 34 ; soft & # 34 ; category here is problematic . at first glance , this brush seems awesome : excellent technology for whitening and cleaning with all sorts of doodads built in and those neat little cups . add in the cheek and tongue brushing and one should be well on the way to super dental health.but for me , this is too tough . even the gentlest brushing with this brush is too rough on my gums , and that roughness is the reason i use soft bristles . i even take special care to avoid my gums as best as possible , but it 's a struggle with this brush.that said , my mouth feels very clean and i do think there is something to the whitening claim.yet i do n't think i 'll get this again . too much gadgetry going on when gentle brushing is a must .
= mixed feelings : great cleaning power , but maybe too tough
< great for whitening and cleaning

> michael winner 's lawman is an interesting western capturing the end of an era with sentimentality of sorts combined with a brutal cathartic streak of graphic violence . if the legends die , they certainly end here with director michael winner 's vision of one era ending and a new one beginning . this one of burt lancaster 's best performances and is an almost symbolic operatic parable that parallels his own career as a major film star whose time in the spotlight was slowly coming to an close . this is a film that bears repeated viewing . its multi-layered structure is very stark yet haunting and the final confrontation in the street leaves the viewer mesmerized . this is very much-overlooked classic from director michael winner .
= brutally cathartic

> i read many books about emotional abuse after going through a nearly life-shattering ordeal and this was the only one that really resonated with me . it dealt with all aspects of what people went through and identified aspects of the victim , the abuser , how and why it happened , why it 's not your fault , etc . it made a huge difference and i was even able to get my friends to read parts of it so that they could understand what happened to some people . i do n't think any one book is right for everyone , but this one was the one for me .

> this has great imagination and a touch of fun . great ya read with characters you love , hate , feel for and want to know better ! step out of the real world , abandon what you think is plausible and enjoy the adventures and strengths of two sister/brother duos from different social backgrounds as they learn to survive on a remote island after being shipwrecked ! these kids face starvation , survival , attack and come out on top ! you will laugh , cry , and be amazed at their combined strengths and what they can do ! great writing !

> the flashlight is compact , sturdy , and extremely bright . less than $ 4 for a 3w led flashlight is an absolute steal by any measure.one thing worth noting is that at the most focused adjustment level ( when the lens is adjusted closest to the light ) the flashlight projects the image of the led circuit . it did n't really bother me at all , but some people may be off put by it .
= fantastic flashlight for the money

> i like netflix , but this app falls into the same category as many i have on my smartphone ... it 's too small to encourage long term use . maybe if i had the larger kindle fire i might feel differently , but i 'm not sure . it 'll work in a pinch , but netflix is better viewed on a large screen like your home hd tv .

> open water 2 : adrift ( hans horn , 2006 ) i was one of those who really liked the original open water . when i heard there was a sequel , i figured it was going to be terrible . but then it started showing up on ifc rather than the syfy channel , and that got me thinking it might actually be better than i was giving it credit for . i was wrong ; it 's inestimably worse . i watched this right after la papesse ( q.v . ) , which was the worst movie i 'd seen in quite a while . well , that record did n't stand long.plot : a bunch of young-and-beautifuls head out on a boat for one 's birthday . they all go out for a swim ( save one , who has an ocean phobia and a daughter -- hey , can you guess who the final girl is in this flick ? , but she gets thrown in by one of her so-called pals ) and forget to let down the ladder . and yes , there they are , stuck in the water right next to the boat but unable to get onto it.while open water 2 is more technically competent than la papesse , that 's the only thing it 's got going for it . could adam kreutner ( dead fish ) have shoehorned any more clich & eacute ; s into this movie ? actually , he probably could have , but i have n't been able to figure out how , from the stupid opening sequence ( which makes you think you 're getting a movie that 's far more thematically linked to the original than you actually do ) right down to the horrid music that plays during the ending you know is coming before you even start watching this movie . in short , everything open water did correctly , this pathetic excuse for a sequel screws up . a terrible , terrible movie .

> `` the interpreter '' is an excellent movie . nicole kidman plays silvia broome , an african-born u.n. interpreter who overhears a conversation about a plot to assassinate the dictator of matobo . federal agent tobin keller ( sean penn ) is then assigned to protect silvia and crack the case.this is a great suspense thriller with an interesting and witty plot . it 's also a psychological drama of sorts : tobin and silvia are both coping with personal losses while trying to deal with the stressful situation at hand . kidman and penn are both amazing oscar-winning actors , and they turn in amazing performances in this film.my favorite thing about `` the interpreter '' is that it is the only feature film that has ever been shot on location inside the united nations . it was great to see the details of these famous and somewhat intimidating government buildings and watch this exciting story unfold . ( there are also some really great scenes shot in the streets of new york as well . ) the only thing that bugged me about this movie was the ending . silvia kind of flips out at the end of the film , and although she definitely has clear motivation for what she does , i had a hard time buying into the fact that she wigged out to such an extreme , and also that her little speech to the dictator appeared to have such a profound effect on him . the story wraps up pretty nicely at the end , though , so that one little inconsistency can easily be forgiven.i highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller : good movies are hard to find these days , and `` the interpreter '' is definitely one you do n't want to miss .

> in 1986 , jason jessup was convicted of killing twelve year old melissa landry . recent testing of dna evidence exonerates jason who will receive a new trial.los angeles office of the district attorney prosecutors are embarrassed as they head to the retrial . they ask defense attorney mickey haller for help ; he agrees with the stipulation that he employs former lapd cop harry bosch as his private investigator and his ex-wife prosecutor maggie `` mcfierce '' mcpherson as the second chair . bosch works the cold case trying to find witnesses from the 1986 homicide of the tweener . he especially wants to find the victim 's older sister whose testimony hung jessup . at the same time , haller finds working for the d.a . quite eye-opening as his every move is under scrutiny while he also distrusts jessup 's sleazy defense attorney . however , perhaps the person all should watch is the one who hated the jurisprudence system before he spent a quarter of a century behind bars ; now he obsessively loathes it and those who work it.the second pairing of this obstinate duet ( see the brass verdict ) makes for a fabulous investigative legal thriller with haller 's former wife on the team ; he is thankful that having been married to her they can never meet in court as she is that tough and good . part of the fun is watching haller switching sides for this case as fans of the lincoln lawyer will see how different what a defense attorney can do vs. a prosecutor . with a strong investigation by bosch and a powerful courtroom drama by haller and mcpherson , the audience will relish the reversal.harriet klausner

> last year i bought my wife the kindle fire as a gift . we use it daily for a multitude of tasks . it has virtually eliminated our laptop from our lives . i found myself using my smartphone to do the same and decided to upgrade to myvown kindle.the fire hd is a step forward in almost every way from the original fire . crisp screen , better ( not perfect ) touch recognition , more internal memory , improved interface and sound.some gripes remain . battery life has not been kind to us . perhaps it is because we use our kindles daily for long periods of time to read , stream video and browse the web but we have to charge them constantly . the browser/kindle also tends to lock up and crash and the kindle will occasionally `` forget '' the prime membership attached to my account , causing undue charges . amazon is always good about clearing these up , it just becomes a nuisance.i would buy another kindle fire hd in a heartbeat . i practically have n't let it out of my sight since i received it . despite the flaws , it is still an amazing value and provides my household everything it needs in a tablet . i do n't mind letting my children handle it as it is sturdy and should something happen to it , i 'm not out $ 800 . i would not give up my kindle for any other tab out there .

> the year is 1928 , and young playboy john is bringing his new bride to his parent 's country estate . his possessive mother ( kristin scott thomas ) is fuming over the marriage and horrified to meet larita ( jessica biel ) , his outspoken , race car-driving , and slightly older wife . john 's father ( colin firth ) , an unhappy veteran of wwi , is the only one in the family who seems to like larita.based on a dramatic play by noel coward but rewritten by the director , this comedy of manners does n't quite succeed . coward 's wit is there , but all of the characters are equally acerbic from the start , tossing around zingy one-liners at breakneck speed ; no one is ever vulnerable or sympathetic and the dialogue sounds forced and unnatural . biel is neither likeable nor believable as the roaring twenties belle and she over-enunciates each word like a stage actress trying to reach the top balcony . nobody plays a snooty aristocrat as well as thomas , but the weak script makes her a one-dimensional witch . firth still looks too young to play a grown man 's father and his shell-shocked veteran role is poorly developed . ben barnes ( john ) looks suitably callow but is unappealing . kris marshall steals the show as a funny butler.this is n't a terrible movie , but it is a disappointing one . 2.5 stars .

> my family are huge disney fans and thus we were very excited to have this new diamond edition release as we are always looking to keep up on the times and have great movies to boot in our collection . in watching this , i have to say that they have come so far since the vhs tape version of this movie that we still have . the digital quality on this diamond edition was amazing , and the movie itself just explodes from the screen ( let alone the sound that you get as well ) .on top of this , you also get an amazing array of bonus features on this that allow you to go behind the scenes to see some things that have not been released in the past and some that have , but that were still great to view again . i loved the tangled short that was included on this as it was definitely one that was worth watching over and over again.all-in-all this was a definite upgrade for my family in regards to quality and my girls simply adored watching the movie again and even they reacted ( at least my oldest did ) about how great it sounded.if you are looking to add a great disney movie to your collection , this is definitely one to bring home today !

> i imagine this is titled 360 because `` ring '' and `` it 's a small world '' were already taken . 360 involves a number of disjointed stories that have a way of intersecting or not . there are many indie films out there that do this , some work better than others . the ones that work have quirky stories that hold our interest . this one does not . the stories consist of an escort , infidelity , a sex offender , a man looking for his missing daughter , and a russian . there may be a few more.the denver airport was filmed in minnesota , apparently they figured no one travels enough to either place to notice . while the acting was n't bad , the stories were presented in a mundane fashion . one of the problems with the film is that you know in advance the story will circle back so you spend your time concentrating on how it is going to do that rather than try to take in what is on the screen.if you like intersecting indie films , try jason freeland 's `` garden party '' a modest production which i enjoyed more than this film.parental guide : f-bomb , sex , and nudity . it had some of each , but really did n't dwell on it .

> `` the secret in their eyes '' is an engrossing mystery and love story , fine-tuned in every aspect . full of beautiful cinematography , mesmerizing performances , and a gripping plot , this is a very satisfying mystery , with love , justice and painful good-byes.a beautiful argentine film with subtitles , with the first scenes aptly describing the unsolved case of a young newlywed 's brutal rape and murder . the film glides between the present and the horrible crime 25 years ago.benjamin esposito ( ricardo darin ) plays the argentine investigator , who is writing a biographical novel about the unsolved case , which he has not been able to let go of . he works with a beautiful colleague , irene menendez hastings ( soledad villamil ) to find the truth . their lives have entwined over the years , and as you watch their interactions against the murder investigation , the fine points of the film structure creep up on you the pieces of a complicated puzzle fit together perfectly and the completion is sharp and smart.overall the movie is well structured , exquisite visuals , and a well acted mystery and love story .

> these anthology movies with multiple directors are usually a dicy proposition , `` new york stories '' with martin scorsese , francis ford coppola , and woody allen helming each segment comes to mind . `` four rooms '' is no exception to this axiom . i wo n't waste a lot of time so i 'll nutshell it . allison anders ' piece is abysmal . how could it not be ? madonna 's in it . alexandre rockwell 's is little better but , then , how could it not be ? the best is robert roriguez 's segment . how could it not be ? antonio banderas is in it . quentin tarantino seems to be phoning in it . he essentially uses this as an opportunity to drink and yuk it up with his buddies , namely an unbilled bruce willis . the verdict is see this for rodriguez 's piece and you might find some minor interest in maybe two of the others .

> with `` lock , stock , and two smoking barrels '' a new voice was heralded with guy ritchie being britain 's answer to quentin tarantino . his followup `` snatch '' did nothing to quell the optimism . this film feels like a parody of those earlier efforts . i give ritchie points for trying to extend himself as a filmmaker but his ambition only goes so far . the quick cut edits induce headaches , the multiple plot threads make you scratch your head , and the narrative is unnecessarily confusing . ritchie tries to cover his tracks by utilizing a variety of film styles and throws in a few notable quotations that only underline the pretentiousness of this whole endeavor . when all is said and done who did n't see the end coming a mile away ? of interest if you have a high tolerance for cinematic gobbledygook .

> 2003 's `` girl with a pearl earing '' offers a detailed recreation of the delft , holland of 1665 , and specifically , of the house of gifted painter johannes vermeer ( colin firth ) . the house is run by vermeer 's mother-in-law ( judy parfit ) , who understands its survival depends on earning commissions from weathly art patrons , including the manipulative master van ruijven ( tom wilkinson ) . vermeer has just finished a painting , and is in need of inspiration.into the house comes a new young maid , griet ( scarlett johansson ) . griet is poor , shy , and illiterate . she is also hardworking , curious , and , to the surprise of vermeer , has an instinctive grasp of the essentials of color , light , and composition in painting . her assistance to his work draws the jealousy of vermeer 's bitter wife katrina ( essie davis ) , the hatred of one of the children , and the mischief-making of master van ruijven , who demands she be the subject of vermeer 's next painting.griet 's life becomes complicated . she is an object of courtship for the handsome butcher 's boy pieter ( cillian murphy ) , of sensuous inspiration for vermeer , and of a crude rape attempt by van ruijven . a quiet conspiracy to complete the painting without katrina 's knowledge is betrayed , leading to a fateful confrontation over griet 's status in the house . `` girl with a pearl earing '' has a solid cast , outstanding production values , and a subtle but intense plot centering on the young griet . as a servant forbidden to speak unless spoken to , scarlett johansson 's griet compellingly portrays her moods and emotions through gesture and expression . unglamorous in servant 's clothing , scrubbed white skin , and work-roughened hands , the innocent act of removing her cap and letting down her long red hair in the presence of vermeer becomes an unconscious intimacy . of such well-crafted moments is made an excellent , highly recommended period movie .

> `` children at play : a cul de sac collection '' by richard thompson ( andrews mcmeel publishing , 2009 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -i had never heard of the `` cul de sac '' newspaper strip before , but this collection has completely won me over . the strip is sort of like `` calvin and hobbes '' with an ensemble cast ; there 's a shared celebration of the twisted , mordant sense of humor that kids can have ( and that adults often find so surprising ) and a familiar imaginative twisting of reality . the main characters are young , preschool-age , not-too-naughty alice and her older brother petey , an agoraphobic fraidy-cat who nonetheless has a pretty good sense of humor . their parents are likable : mom always tries to put a positive spin on things , while dad ( much like calvin 's dad ) is more laconic and low-energy -- a hard day at work makes him just a little bit too grumpy to follow all of alice 's flights of fancy.much of the action takes place at alice 's nursery school , where a handful of oddball kids cluster together and try and figure out the world ; there 's also a lot of talking at the family dinner table and alice coming into petey 's room to try and pry him away from his ever-present comic books . the humor is hard to describe ; really you just have to read it . but parents who like to laugh at their own foibles as well as those of their kids , or fans of `` calvin and hobbes '' , will find a lot to laugh about here . definitely recommended -- i wish there was another volume out that i could read as well !

> my first exposure to this film was overhearing a bunch of my fellow students at uco describing going 'fishing ' with a plastic tarantula at a local theatre 's showing of `` arachnophobia . '' yes , the unlucky theatre-goers caught by the bait had the predictable reaction.notwithstanding their illicit activities , my classmates said the film was one of the funniest they 'd ever seen.i was dubious , but based on their recommendation , i went to see `` arachnophobia '' one weekday afternoon at the same theatre where they 'd pulled their prank.first off , i have never been to a show where the threatre staff is standing at the door watching for suspicious bundles . anything long that could house a fishing pole or whatnot had to be checked.then , when the previews were over , the houselights never went down . one of my fellow audience members went to ask why and the theatre management announced that due to some mischief they were keeping the lights up.plus -- we had an usher in attendance throughout the whole show.yep , my classmates were right . i did laugh my head off . `` arachnophobia '' pokes fun at every killer spider movie as well as our own fear of spiders . i went back to see the film again and still laughed . `` snakes on a plane '' caused me to revisit some of my favorite parody films . started out on a rainy day with the lights off . my siamese cat jumped up behind me and i screamed like a highschool girl.yep -- i put all the lights on in the room and i was back to laughing again . after all these years , `` arachnophobia '' is still a lot of fun and one of the best parodies i have ever seen . the cat even liked it -- he had a great time trying to catch the spiders on the screen.uhhhh -- -just keep the lights on and lock your cat out !

> other reviewers are right - it 's much more mint than aqua . which is what i was hoping for.what i really like about it is what it is made out of . it 's kind like the stuff they make barbie dolls out of , i think . heavy , semi-hard , flexible plastic . not as soft as a gel case , but not hard plastic , either . i 'm very happy with that . fits snug , but you do n't need a crow bar to get it off , either . it obviously adds some bulk to the ultra slim galaxy siii , but not much and i found the phone almost too slim and hard to keep hold of , so a little heft was a good thing for me.all in all , a simple , practical case that i would highly recommend.i got two , one in mint that i prefer and use alone ( the color is just too pretty ) , and one in pink that i use with a sinji pouch for things like concerts and places i do n't want to carry a bag .

> just the name california brings up images in our minds . they may be of the big hollywood sign , the watts riots , the gigantic redwood trees , the pacific ocean , the images run on and on . in this book , mr. starr gives a history beginnning with the first mention of the name in a 1510 book where it was stated that california was an island.from there he has written perhaps the best single volume history of the state yet written . he has pictured california with all its greatness , and with its problems . he talks about the beauty , the climate , the life that california provides . he also mentions the soaring housing prices , grid-locked freeways , poor state government and more . it 's a fair look at the state as it exists today and as it was in the past.mr . starr is a professor at usc and for ten years was the state librarian . he has written many time of california , this is the distillation of a lifetime of work .

> i 've read several books in this series and have long been impressed by using some popular bit of media to generate philosophical discussions . i 've been a & # 34 ; supernatural & # 34 ; fan since the first episode and was excited to see it treated the same way . however , unlike the other books , this one leans more towards discussing the show and less discussion of philosophy . instead of a near-perfect fusion of the two , this one is pretty much & # 34 ; supernatural & # 34 ; good times with philosophy thrown in here and there . did i mind ? i did n't , though those looking for more solid philosophical though might be disappointed . even as it was , i still found the topics generated to be interesting and appropriate as the philosophers picked from the most obvious and anticipated discussions to ideas that surprised me . this book is definitely a bit more intelligent discussion of the show , and i appreciated that .
= more supernatural than philosophy , but nothing wrong with that
< a bit more intelligent discussion of the show

> i 'm surprised by the glowing reviews for this book . i thought the ending was obvious from the first hundred pages , the abuses of the legal system very hard to believe ( and i would have thought impossible if i did n't know grisham was a lawyer ) , and the 'insights ' into race relations in the american south shallow at best.as always , though , grisham writes with ease . and while i never found myself eager to find out what was on the next page or in the next chapter , it was a pleasant read.there are a lot of mouthy old drunks in this book , which feels appropriate . ultimately this is a novel about courtroom procedures in a small southern town , told in the style of a good ole boy sitting on his porch and unraveling his tale slowly and with huge helpings of irrelevant detail . it 's a nice enough way to spend the evening , but not a night -- or a book -- to remember .

> after a luxury ocean liner is capsized by a tsunami , a handful of survivors must struggle to reach the hull before the ship sinks entirely . watching the cast of recognizable stars struggle against both the overturned boat and the constraints of a cheesy , clich & eacute ; -ridden screenplay provides a certain amount of undeniable fun . gene hackman sinks his teeth into the role of a righteous , rebellious priest and manages to deliver with real conviction lines that would sink most actors . ernest borgnine also does well in the role he was born to play -- a tough bone-head who is basically a nice guy . this is one of the best-known of the 70s disaster flicks , a genre of film that consisted of placing large casts of former oscar-winners in peril and then knocking them off one by one . taken on its own terms , it 's quite enjoyable though undemanding./

> when the great films of the seventies are talked about generally it 's the more edgier fare from the maverick directors ( altman , scorsese , coppola ) are elevated . `` the man who would be king '' is rarely given the exulted status it deserves . basically , john huston 's film is an old-fashioned adventure that just flat-out entertains . this is a tale that is just well told . it was casting from heaven that teamed up sean connery and michael caine as the rogue soldiers who scheme to elevate themselves as gods in an isolated society . it 's a wonder that connery and caine never reteamed in a film again because their chemistry is as good as any pairings in screen history . it 's a toss-up as to whether this film or `` the treasure of the sierra madre '' is huston 's greatest accomplishment .

> this 300 mbps wireless 802.11n usb adapter is the easiest way to get a laptop with a broken wireless system back on the network or to connect a desktop computer to a network via wifi.with some windows computers , it is plug and play , or there is a driver included on a mini-cd ; for macs , a driver can be download from realtek.this adapter is small enough to leave in place on a notebook computer even when placed in a sleeve ; it protrudes about 3/4 in.there is a blue led indicator in the form of the wifi symbol to show activity.it produces a strong , consistent signal that is easily found halfway down the hallway of my apartment building , through several walls.i would highly recommend this as effective , easy , and inexpensive.a sample was provided for testing and unbiased review .

> ignore `` dude , where 's my car '' and the campy pranks on punk 'd - ashton kutcher is first and foremost an actor , and it shows in this dark drama of a sex abuse survivor who struggles to change history to protect both himself and those he loves . an interesting premise based on the `` if you could , should you try '' ? question of time travel and altering history . kutcher 's angst is excellent in this accurate portrayal of an abuse survivor . the scenes of child molestation , while suggested and not shown , are deeply disturbing as they should be . recommend for very mature audiences .

> i found this trilogy to be incredibly engaging . that said , i think a lot of comparisons are unfair - it 's nowhere near as amazing as harry potter and thank goodness it 's not twilight . it stands on its own as a well-written , original story that will engage teens as well as adults . the dystopian society that the books portray can be a bit intense and depressing , but it feels incredibly real , and you feel the characters hopelessness . i could n't put the books down and i would highly recommend the trilogy to anyone looking for a good read .

> `` born standing up '' is primarily about steve martin 's life as a stand-up comic . according to him , he spent ten years learning , four refining the material , and four in wild success.martin begins in settings that sometimes lack even an audience , and for no pay . like johnny carson , martin began with an early interest in magic , augmented by selling programs etc . at disneyland ( sometimes working in a magic store ) , and then on to knot 's berry farm for small acting roles.a disastrous ( fortunately ) experience with pot was followed by work as a writer to provide more steady income than was possible as a stand-up . at age 28 , martin just decided to make it work , and quit writing to focus full-time on stand-up . first as a warm-up act , then on to become the main event - after martin decided that he no longer would relegate himself to second-fiddle status . then came appearances on johnny carson , saturday night live , `` capped '' by a bad review by his father writing for his local real estate salesmen 's group . ( martin 's chosen profession had not gone over well with his father - perhaps because martin senior had wanted to follow that path himself , but been unable to do so.from playing to sometimes empty venues , martin now found himself looking at audiences of 10,000+ . great success , by any-one 's definition . somehow , though , martin decided to end it - partly because of loneliness and high stress . he then focused on reconciliation with his dad ( his mother always adored his success ) and sister , and succeeded.a nice story about what assuredly is a nice person .

> this case looks very nice , protects and holds the kindle snuggly , and best of all it easily transforms into a stand that is perfect for viewing movies at your desk or on an airplane . it is durable , attractive , and well made . the case protects your kindle very well and does n't add too much bulk to it.in general , i like book cover style cases because the front flips out of the way , enabling easy use of the device . most book cover styles cases do not have the stand feature that this one does . if you use you kindle for movies frequently , or for reading in landscape mode , the stand feature is a life saver . i used to rest my kind against a large eraser on my desk for movie viewing and reading , but the case does that job much better . it also fits very well on airplane tray tables.the only complaint that i have about this case is that the tab sometimes flops forward when i 'm using the kindle . it is designed to stick back , and out of the way , but the magnet for this purpose is not strong enough . it is pretty distracting to have the tab randomly flopping out of its storage position.overall , the belkin glam tab standing case does everything that i hoped it would . i recommend it .
= not just attractive and protective , also works really well as a stand .

> the bap handbook sheds a humorous and informative light on ladies of the upper/middle-class who have become known as black american princesses . there are four distinct types of baps , yet they all have one thing in common they `` want the best and nothing less . `` the first type of bap is the betty . she is born and bred into a prominent family and acts accordingly . the second type of bap is the boho . like the betty , she comes from prominent family , but she in unorthodox in her style and her behavior . the third type is the butterfly . the butterfly resembles the betty , but she did not come from an important family . she usually discovers her `` bapness '' in college . last is the bogus . just as the name implies the bogus is a `` wannabe '' and is considered to be `` ghetto fabulous . `` the book follows these types baps from birth until marriage . it has excellent resources and could also be used as a book of etiquette . the book 's audience tends to be the upper class or upper-middle-class , so unless the reader is a member of those classes , the book may appear to be a little condescending . nonetheless , i recommend it as an enjoyable , quick read and reference guide.reviewed by latoya carter-qawiyythe rawsistaz reviewers

> star trek into darkness is a well paced and emotionally involving chapter in the lucrative star trek franchise . this installment , helmed by j.j. abrams straddles the fine line between computer animation and human emotions , similar in tone and philosophy to the groundbreaking original star trek television series . perhaps i 'm jaded but after awhile computer animation battle scenes becomes numbingly tiresome . but more often than not mr. abrams bails out of frantic action sequences with the human story- the individual and group heroics essential to the star trek legend also provides needed gravitas to the story.acting is first rate , the villains multi-faceted and the heroism exhibited by kirk , spock , and others is noteworthy and serves to drive the story to heights not usually seen in space operas . i still have issues with chris pine as kirk ( he lacks emotional credibility and depth ) but the terrific supporting cast- including a marvelous turn by zachary quinto as spock- serves to support the story and add color . plots owing much to revenge and retribution are often easier to `` sell '' because of the visceral emotions those feelings convey to people . it 's easy to invest in this sort of story and mr. abrams and the screenwriters capitalize on it.very impressive and well done . 4.5 stars .
= surprisingly good tale
< well paced and emotionally involving chapter in the star trek franchise

> while my favorite text on project management is visualizing project management , this handly treasure chest of pm knowledge and techniques is my constant companion . it is much more than a quick reference quide - it contains a lot of information that i have n't stumbled across in any other project management book , such as metrics , estimating techniques and sound advice on a number of pm topics that are presented concisely . in other words , this book has a lot of meat and no fluff.if you are starting out as a project manager i recommend visualizing project management as your first book . however , if you are a practicing and experienced project manager this is & quot ; must-have & quot ; . and the price is right ! when was the last time you found a decent book on project management ( or any other technical or business subject ) priced below $ 15.00 ? price aside , the value of this book is the content and the fact that it covers project management the way it should be covered : work breakdown structures , risk management , earned value and other controls . i strongly recommend this book .

> ender 's game is a great sci-fi in many ways . it is a much easier to read than many futuristic pieces and the settings are vivid although somewhat left to the imagination ( am i just saying i have a good imagination ) the novel follows ender as he completes military training to defeat 'the buggers ' . in order to succeed ender must survive his murderous brother , fellow students , the games that his superiors play , and eventually the enemy themselves.my problem with the book is that its main drawcard is the ending twist . the rest of the book lacks real tension . the main character is a child prodigy who never looses a battle , so one reads the book without any fear of the protaganist failing or the need for a resolution of tension.the character development is relatively basic , although there are a few satisfying revalations . there are also the occasional interesting philosophies on warfare throughout ender 's lessons.ultimately ender 's game is an excellent beginning to a series and a relatively easy read . recommended to sci-fi fans and those who enjoy straightforward books .

> i have nicknamed this software bugmaster . it lightened my wallet by $ 100 at circuit city . i needed a program to edit a dvd home movie on a crash basis . i wasted an entire evening trying to get the software to work . it does not work . i tried it on two different late-model computers . no dice . i had owned a roxio product 5 or 6 years ago , so i tried logging onto their website to see if there was a bug fix , but because i could not remember the ancient password , no luck there either , and although they said they had emailed me a new password , they had not.fact is , i am tired of software vendors that do this -- they package a bug-ridden and downright inoperable software program hoping to sucker users into buying it , with the intention of putting their users through some god-awful time consuming patching process . they have to know that their software does not work.avoid this product . i would not want it even if it were free . my time is not free .
= did n't work . period
< does not work

> overall a very good ending to the series . i do have a couple complaints with the book.first , it needed one more chapter , to jump 19 years and not explain what happend in between , especially how order returned to the wizardly world left a lot of loose ends . who lived , who died , did they return to school to graduate , what happened to the mistreated half-bloods and who rounded up all the dementors ? second , some of the deaths happen `` off camera '' , maybe she did this to lessen them , but after investing in these characters all these years , it almost feels like they were killed just for the shock value alone.i know the book is written from harry 's point of view and there is obviously a lot going on he does n't know about , but you are left wondering how wizards in other countries are responding to voldemort and the death eaters , why hogwarts was not better prepared for a seige and i ca n't help wondering what everyone else is doing while harry is having his adventures .

> this rubbermaid deck box is lightweight plastic . it comes with a hole on the lid to attach a padlock.assembly was easy . i did n't like having to punch out the tabs with a hammer and flathead screwdriver , but it was n't tremendously difficult . the pieces snapped in like they should . i had to have my husband help me with a few of the screws , because the plastic had indentations for the screws but no holes.i 'd have liked this deck box to be a little bigger ( my fault for not measuring ) . the back and seat cushions for my four chairs did not all fit . in fact , i could only get the back cushions in.it 's a sturdy box . i 'm not sure if it leaks . if it survives the next rain , i 'll try remember to come back to update.______________________update 11/29/12 : this box still looks new after more than a year . it 's raining today and i checked . the box is dry inside , no leaks .

< lightweight , but not great

> you get everything you need to set this up right out of the box , as you can see by the product description . i think this product can do anything except maybe your grocery shopping . you can easily turn your laptop/netbook into a full desktop set up . 4 usb ports makes it wonderfully convenient to be able to hook up your mouse , keyboard and even other products like weather forecaster that needs to be constantly pulling information out of the ether.as others have mentioned there is a problem with resolution . it can be fixed ( but not perfectly ) by changing the display resolution . there are also some problems with erratic video . these are huge problems for the person who is reliant on video or photos in their workplace . hooking up a digital camera and a printer proved to be impossible for me . there are more cons than pro 's with this product and at this point , it is just functioning as a very expensive phone and tablet charger

> presenting hit songs every year for over 5 years now , the wow series has made a name for itself in the christian market . with this cd set , the series turns its eye toward christmas music with good but not great results.the first song , avalon 's take on `` winter wonderland '' should give you a clue what you 're in for . while most of the 31 songs are familiar , they have been arranged to fit the musical styles of the artists who perform them here . while i enjoy alternative arrangements , too many get on my nerves . this is especially true when we get into artists whose styles i 'm not fond of anyway . and it hardly feels like christmas music , even if you already know the song.one plus of this two disc set , however , is that many of the songs are new recordings . artists without christmas cd 's have recorded songs that are only available here , and it 's nice to have the new material , which represents almost half of the set.most of the songs are the classics we hear every year , but some artists are represented by their more original , new classics . for example , we get michael w. smith 's , `` emmanuel , '' amy grant 's `` breath of heaven , '' and 4 him 's `` strange way to save the world . '' also falling into this category is `` mary , did you know ? '' sung here by kathy mattea and plus one 's `` a prayer for every year . '' while i appreciate their attempt to christianize `` grown up christmas list , '' i somehow find it lyrically lacking and ultimately disappointing.ultimately , i find the songs i 'm drawn to most to be the ones from cd 's i already have and love . it 's a good set , but i do n't see it getting more then a couple listens each year .

> apparently there is a project to `` re-imagine '' all six of jane austen 's complete novels , set them in modern times and have them scribed by some of today 's well regarded authors . joanna trollope 's version of austen 's first novel sense and sensibility is the initial title to be released in this series and in my opinion is barely an `` ok '' attempt . in this retelling the sisters and their mother lose their lovely house to their half brother and his obnoxious wife because their dad never got around to actually marrying their mother . other changes to force the story in to the 21st century make elinor an architecture student ( who improbably is forced to quit right before finishing her program because of the changes in her family fortunes ) marianne plays the guitar rather than the pianoforte and is afflicted with asthma while middle school age margaret is upset because she has to change schools . modern versions of edward ferrars , willoughby and colonel brandon are on hand as well as contemporary variants of the original novel 's supporting cast.though the personalities of austen 's characters and their relationships with each other translate well enough from early 19th century england to 21st century britain so many social customs , norms and attitudes have changed that much of the original plot does not seem plausible even with trollope 's adjustments for today 's times . trollope is a more than decent author of the `` chick lit '' vein but this attempt to update a beloved british classic seems a waste of her talents and the readers ' time .

> do you believe any of this is possible ? a chicken deliberately dies so she can come back as a hamster and live in her human 's house.some people can communicate with animals , both dead and alive , telepathically as fully as one would talk to another human being.animal spirits can decide when and where to be reborn . they may be reborn as the same species or inhabit the body of a totally different species . in one anecdote we read about a woman 's mother coming back as a horse.some animals are hit by cars on purpose so that they can travel to the spiritual realm.we even learn in this book that animals who want to see what it 's like to be human , come back as a human born with a terminal disease so they can try out humanity for a short time.and then there 's the cat who escaped from its yard so it could be killed by a fox , a fox who faked a limp to attract the attention of the cat 's owner and then explain to the owner what had happened . after the fox-human conversation , the fox mysteriously loses its limp.if you find all these goings-on credible , then this book may be for you . as for this potato head , all of these other world shenanigans seem too far fetched and incredible . i read this book seeking some reassurance and confirmation that animals have surviving souls.this book of the `` fantastic '' was n't reassuring to me though i do appreciate the author 's respect for and love of animals .

> when i first took a teaspoon of this chipotle in my mouth , there was a temporary light taste of vaguely sweet raspberry overcome with a strong and very spicy charcoal taste that lingered . you can smell the charcoal ( roasted ) flavor long after swallowing . i almost tossed it out.the idea of using it on crackers or taco chips sounded disgusting . then i baked a thick pork loin chop with it ( only the last 15 minutes ) and the flavor completely changed to a more subtle and spicy flavor . it was much better than just a tabasco or ketchup/butter dipping . then i used it in a burrito with beef , cheese , etc . and it was equally as good . last try was with a sirloin steak . i marinated it for several hours before broiling it . it was a bit more charcoal in taste , but still adequate . it did overwhelm the natural flavor of the steak , but it was still flavorful . i think the secret is to use it sparingly . i 'm guessing it would be better used on a less expensive piece of meat and especially good on a bbq , which is my next test.it is a bit expensive for chipotle and food is such a subjective matter . i 'd recommend trying it before buying a six-pack of it . i could easily see some people disliking the strong flavor and others probably drinking the stuff right out of the bottle . it works for me .
= taste is subjective

> gravity is fine if you just take it for what it is : a sci-fi thriller that is watchably compelling , with a number of twists and turnabouts , but without a lot of plot depth , character development , or any of that sort of thing . it has a few stretches and improbabilities , but it 's hard to make a film of this sort without some of those . comparisons have been made with2001 : a space odyssey , but gravity does not begin to hold the slightest nubbin of a candle to a classic of that stature . all the same , good performances by bullock ( dr. ryan stone ) and clooney ( `` veteran astronaut '' matt kowalski ) , who are the only living characters we actually see here . though the earth below looks rather artificial , some nice use of gadgetry and special effects.i put off watching gravity because it looked fairly predictable . it does , however , go in some unexpected directions . yet , the story starts a bit too late : more on the nature of the shuttle mission and the relationships between stone , kowalski , and the rest of the crew before the disasters strike would have added something even if it would also have complicated things . purely a matter of taste , but i think the middle portions would have benefited from more on the angst and strange thoughts that arise while trapped alone in space and less of the constant thriller-diller stuff we have here .

> this would make an excellent companion volume to roni sarig'sthe secret history of rock : the most influential bands you 've never heardandin the fascist bathroom : punk in pop music , 1977-1992by greil marcus , esp . since marcus ' book mostly ignores the ny scene . it details the origins of the us punk and art rock scene , like patti smith , tom verlaine , richard hell & the ramones who were the originators of many stylistic and musical traits evident in latter-day bands . it 's an american punk who 's who and a rock 'n roll what 's what , a detailed history and a valuable reference work . starting with the velvet underground , it covers the stooges , mc5 , modern lovers , electric eels , suicide , ny doll , wayne county , blondie , the heartbreakers , talking heads , pere ubu , lydia lunch and other seminal artists . this is done in the form of interviews with the artists concerned , so you hear about the times in their own words . the famous venues cbgb 's & max 's kansas city also get their due . the bibilography provides a cross-section of the most useful published sources on american punk an there 's an extensive discography . black & white photographs ( some very rare , like a pic of patti smith 's graduation ) enliven the text . highly recommended for fans of intelligent rock music .

> middle-aged lawrence ( bill nighy ) is a withdrawn but highly-placed number cruncher in the uk government who lives a miserably isolated life . one day , he shares a cafe table with gina ( kelly macdonald ) , an equally-shy , twenty-something and the two strike up an awkward conversation . one thing leads to another and she ends up accompanying lawrence to the g8 conference in iceland , where the world 's leaders will probably , as usual , ignore the devastating problem of world poverty.directed by david yates , this wonderful bbc movie is equal parts drama , romance , and a serious call to action regarding world hunger . ever the numbers-man , lawrence is full of horrifying statistics concerning the horrors of poverty , the most important being 'one person dies every three seconds . ' gina takes the problem to heart and causes quite a stir at the g8 . nighy and macdonald give touching performances , reflecting the torment of loneliness and also the need to stand up for what is morally right.i highly recommend this very thoughtful film . as much as i enjoyed the acting , i was also moved by the message that one person can make a difference . a star-studded appeal for help in the fight against world poverty is included in the dvd extras .
= `` is 'all right ' good enough ? ''

> this novel is about liesel , an illiterate girl who loses her family and is raised by foster parents in a german town . her foster father , whom she calls papa , teaches her to read in the wee hours of the morning when liesel awakens from nightmares . the highlights of the book for me were liesel 's relationships with a jewish man harbored in the basement of her foster parents ' home , rudy who is a classmate and neighbor and a nazi woman whose husband is the mayor.the character development was excellent . i felt like i knew so many of the people . it is well written and i think it would appeal to teens and young adults.i would have given this book 5 stars , but i did n't like having the book narrated by death . i know many like this , but to me it seemed like a gimmick . it could have been told by liesel . in addition , death would tell us what was going to happen in the future long before the actual events . that said , i did enjoy some of death 's prose toward the end of the book .

> okay so maybe i am like the very last person on earth to read this book , but what can i say ? i hate clowns . it took some courage for me to finally read this book . now that i have , i know why i did n't read it before . do n't get me wrong , this book is excellent and although it is long , it is possibly one of the most intriguing stephen king novels i have ever read . the plot keeps twisting and as the story unfolds , the double story line becomes more and more interesting , drawing you in and refusing to let go.i have to say , even though clowns have never been my favorite , for one reason or the other , the general public seems to enjoy having the living crap scared out of them and i guess i am no exception . although i could n't sleep at all the night i finished reading this book and i will never look at a rain gutter the same way again , i appreciate that this book was powerful enough to scare me . well played mr. king , well played .

> whiskey rebellion : an addison holmes mysteryi just finished this book and i spent one of the best days i 've had lately by reading this . i love it when a book makes me sigh in disappointment because i 've finished it . it had a lot going for it . it was humorous , mysterious , and sexy without being overly sexual . this book has a mystery that was not revealed until the very end . it has slapstick maneuvers and a fairly kick-butt heroine and a lovely sexy male protagonist ( i wo n't say hero since addie can mostly ... mostly ... take care of herself ) .i 've seen reviewers compare this book to janet evanovich 's stephanie plum series , and while i see some similarities , i have higher hopes for ms harts efforts . i think that she will be able to have addison grow and there is no choice for addison to make as far as boyfriends ( lovers ) go . at least not yet and i hope never.book two in this series , `` whiskey sour '' , should be coming out this autumn .

> wow ! after 5 years - i have never been happier that i own a kindle.could n't put it down , and i kept wondering how and where the author did her research for those detailed , engrossing and highly erotic episodes . the characters are interesting and believable in a way that any woman can relate to.back in the day there was an author named harold robbins that kept my mom and other ladies of her generation captivated with terrific stories and some very heated hook-ups . well , finally my generation has our own author who knows how to weave a wicked tale that will leave you wanting more . i immediately bought the next 2 installments because i did n't want to miss a thing . and neither will you.this ai n't no bella & edward . these books are for adults - for women out there who want something more than just `` gazing longingly into each others eyes '' , blah blah blah . this one is a little rough - but you wo n't be able to put it down . you 'll see .

> actually 3.5 stars . i enjoyed this more than i thought i would . i 'm a bit tired of french vampires , ( ca n't we have italian or russian ones ? ) but i liked dante and he was certainly a tortured enough hero . i liked the world building and the spin on the elohim and yahweh . and i really liked dante , brutally trained to be psychotic , and struggling to be decent . heather , the fbi agent tracking down the cck serial killer , who crosses paths with dante , was also a bit deeper and more interesting than most heroines . all in all a satisfying book , with lots of twists and turns ( though heather flying all on her lonesome to the mad woman 's work place was a bit like the heroine going alone into the basement , but it all worked out ok in the end ... ) and i immediately looked for the sequel . a bit of sex/romance but the thriller/world building aspect was given more time and attention .

> we went to watch this last night on opening night because my daughter has seen the advertisements for weeks . her favorite part is olaf especially when he sneezes and his head falls off . imagine our surprise when that is not in the movie . matter of fact quite a few scenes from the commercials/teasers are not in the movie . the movie was n't bad but completely misrepresented . it made it seem it was more of the snowman and reindeer but it 's not . they have small roles . it is a disney & # 34 ; princess & # 34 ; movie and a musical . also like many of the older disney movies it involves death for the parents . ( i feel that should be known for any sensitive children before you go . ) overall my kids liked it although they both noticed the funny parts from the commercials were n't there . they both did immediately want to buy it on dvd but i am hesitant . i had higher hopes .

> i grew up watching this film every time it came on tv . i have never out grown this classic . none of the various `` journey to the center of the earth '' films are accurate adaptations of the book . in fact i was a bit disappointed reading the book after seeing the film . it lacked the drama and conflict of the motion picture . the acting was great , even down to the supporting cast.i have always believed this is a film that could be done better with all the modern cg stuff . to date it has n't . while the backdrop has gotten better , the storyline and acting does not come up to snuff with this 1959 studio film where the rocks are flat and smooth for safe walking . the soundtrack is the old time drama/thriller music used in every film . it worked very well.for my money , this is the one to own . good movie for the whole family to enjoy .

> the undeniable importance of the molecular biology has achieved in the last two decades such transcendental outburst of energy , advances and extraordinary finfings that hardly we should devote entirely to be informed about the multiple consequences of its profound implications.this book is a true effort worthy to admire , because it has been written with this kind spirit of sharing the knowledge wothout pretensions or any other considerations.once you open it , you will be absoltely engaged due its relevant interest , because of the fact there ` s a lot of secondnary readings and discoveries all over the world that it should be be stated of this way . may one not being aware about the structure of the cell and the mesmerizing devices the nature employs to show us its lavish dynamics.additionally the support material of this cd rom simply is priceless . i insist , you do n't need to be an expert in this issue to start.decide by yourself and please , dont wait so long .

> zailckas ' fictional debut certainly is a fascinating one . told in alternating chapters and perspectives , this intimate look into one family 's drama draws the reader in from the very beginning . sixteen year old violet and twelve year old will may narrate their sections in distinct voices , but the real focus of the book is the titular mother , josephine . her presence dominates every page in a destructive and darkly gripping manner . secrets , lies , and varying versions of the truth all come together to create an eerie and quite awful life behind the closed doors of this very disturbed and broken family . the plot follows familiar paths but the fast pacing compensates for some of its predictability . the characters all vividly come to life . and the forbidding and ominous tone is well maintained as the book moves towards its climax.it 's an absorbing read , and i look forward to seeing what type of story zailckas will tell next !

> 2003 's `` we will prevail '' is a compendium of president george bush 's public speeches in the first two years of the global war on terrorism . put together by national review , it features minimal commentary in the form of a short foreword by peggy noonan and an equally short introduction by jay nordlinger , both veteran republican speech-writers.bush 's controversial presidency wo n't get a serious non-partisan review for years , if not decades . a quick scan of the reviews associated with this book indicates the huge span of current opinion . only time will tell whether bush 's policies will ultimately work for the best . nevertheless , the speeches captured here will be a resource for future biographers , some of whom may decide that bush was a more effective public speaker than he is usually given credit for being .

> mel gibson and danny glover produce some wonderful chemistry in this moody , contorted cop flick . gibson plays a cop with something of a crazy streak , which condition has been exacerbated by the death of his wife . glover is a stable family man who is less than thrilled with being paired up with gibson , who he regards as a nut case . but the duo is up against a powerful criminal gang , which soon causes their partnership to meld into a real friendship . there is some good stuff in this film about marksmanship and shooting that firearms enthusiasts will like . some of my favorite scenes are where glover and gibson are checking out one another 's marksmanship at the police shooting range . all in all , glover and gibson both carry off their roles impeccably . most viewer will come to care for the glover and gibson characters as they come to care for one another . great buddy chemistry here.this is an amazingly violent film , no doubt of that . but the violence does not overpower the storyline or the acting . this is a film that many viewers will watch repeatedly , and of course it was good enough to generate three sequels . highly recommended . rjb .
